| Dimension                     | **PCC (Pressure–Control–Chaos)**                                    | **Good Regulator Theorem (GRT)**                                  |

| **Core Question**             | Why do some systems fail to stabilize despite regulation?           | What is required for a system to be effectively controlled?       |
| **Primary Focus**             | **Instability structure** and cyclic dominance                      | **Control and regulation** via internal modeling                  |
| **System Type**               | Multi-agent, competitive, non-transitive systems                    | Controller–system (regulator–environment) systems                 |
| **Key Principle**             | Stability emerges (or fails) from **interacting forces** (P, C, Ch) | Effective regulation requires an **internal model of the system** |
| **View of Stability**         | Often **non-convergent**, oscillatory, or metastable                | Achievable if regulator sufficiently models system                |
| **Equilibrium Concept**       | Not central; systems may orbit or avoid fixed points                | Implicit goal: maintain system near desired state                 |
| **Dynamics**                  | Intrinsically **cyclic / non-transitive**                           | Typically **feedback-driven stabilization**                       |
| **Role of Control**           | One component among others; **not dominant**                        | Central: control is the defining mechanism                        |
| **Role of Chaos / Noise**     | Fundamental: **disrupts and prevents closure**                      | Treated as disturbance to be minimized                            |
| **Role of Pressure**          | Drives directional change / exploitation                            | Not explicitly modeled                                            |
| **Modeling Requirement**      | Not required globally; emerges locally through interactions         | **Mandatory**: regulator must encode system model                 |
| **Information Theory Role**   | Distributed across components (entropy injection vs reduction)      | Central: regulation = **entropy reduction via modeling**          |
| **Failure Mode**              | Persistent cycling, instability, non-convergence                    | Poor control due to insufficient model                            |
| **Interpretation of Failure** | Structural: instability is **built into system topology**           | Informational: failure due to **model mismatch**                  |
| **Scalability**               | Naturally extends to multi-agent systems                            | Typically framed as single regulator vs system                    |
| **Typical Outcomes**          | Limit cycles, spirals, oscillatory regimes                          | Stabilized trajectories, bounded error                            |
| **Mathematical Alignment**    | Replicator dynamics, nonlinear systems, cyclic games                | Control theory, cybernetics, information theory                   |
| **Philosophical Framing**     | Stability is **relational and dynamic**                             | Stability is **achievable through knowledge**                     |
| **What It Explains Best**     | Why equilibrium is not reached in cyclic systems                    | Why effective control requires internal representation            |
| **Blind Spot**                | Does not yet formalize optimal control strategies                   | Does not address **competitive or non-transitive dynamics**       |
