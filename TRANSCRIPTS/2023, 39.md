## TRANSCRIPT
0:00     
come back into Focus here oh okay hello hello hello     
0:09     
Morgan good morning morning so uh how's everyone     
0:16     
today how was uh know Susan was we were talking about your project on you know     
0:23     
for the Last Supper weeks so well I'm still working on it but I     
0:28     
found um uh tiling that would go in a a square     
0:34     
box for the sides of both the triangle prism and my hexagon     
0:43     
configuration and it goes straight down and up instead of twisting all over the     
0:49     
place so I've I've bought something and maybe a     
0:54     
um I can say well we can try all these other other configurations ations too so     
1:02     
um I have I filled out that section I just need to do the hexagon     
1:10     
model yeah maybe in a couple of days I'm going to write up the triangle and and     
1:17     
some of the other things and make sure my essays together paper whatever yeah     
1:27     
yeah yeah it's going to be a 10,000 words paper oh okay yeah that's right right     
1:34     
about like a very nice long publication yeah yeah this is what cells     
1:40     
do so this and this is what I've done to try to model     
1:45     
them yeah yeah well that's great good luck with that yeah yeah well at least     
1:53     
it goes straight up and down it runs into itself but I knew that would happen so yeah     
2:02     
great uh Morgan how are     
2:08     
you H I am just uh getting things ready here for the school run um yeah at uh um     
2:17     
yeah just um well I'll be listening in and um happy to yeah happy to hear what     
2:25     
you guys are talking about yeah yeah I AG great hi Jesse how are     
2:36     
you good yeah     
2:41     
hi so yeah uh I guess I don't know if dick will join us today he asked about     
2:47     
like our progress on the uh the paper that we're working on for the uh sort of     
2:54     
the molecular biology of differentiation and uh working on     
3:00     
revising that um you know it it'll take a while but I think we'll get it out uh     
3:06     
hopefully by the end of the year but um you know it's it's actively being worked     
3:12     
on so um just have to kind of incorporate some comments and uh you     
3:20     
know rethink some things and so U that's good     
3:25     
um yeah so we have we've finished up     
3:30     
with our gach stuff and we have um San     
3:36     
uh you know he he's busy right now he'll be joining rejoining our group uh soon     
3:41     
next couple weeks um and then I know that uh hansu had wanted to uh continue     
3:49     
on I don't know he's been uh having his own issues over the summer so you know     
3:56     
we hopefully you know he want if he wants to to join in he's welcome to um otherwise I don't I'm not going to     
4:04     
really go over any of the repositories today but uh you know we have to kind of     
4:10     
keep on the treadmill with this because the new gach projects are you know they     
4:16     
want to see proposals at the end of January so oh wow kind of comes sooner     
4:22     
than you'd like so U you know I'm thinking about continuing some of the projects that we were working on this     
4:29     
summer or you know maybe some of the projects we were working on uh last year     
4:36     
yeah and I'm sorry I haven't got you those images of eggs yet they're more fuzzy than flipping     
4:45     
microscope eggs yeah images because the cameras aren't aren't as     
4:52     
good um and I took a whole bunch of the flipping microscope images and so I was     
4:59     
able ble to choose ones that were in Focus     
5:05     
so yeah yeah um anyway I just haven't     
5:10     
got there I I need to finish this project oh yeah yeah definitely paper     
5:16     
and they want me to present this early either late dece or mid December or     
5:22     
early January so um whichever yeah     
5:27     
anyways yeah that's good anyway     
5:33     
I'll yeah I mean I've talked to harri Krishna recently about some of the     
5:39     
things he he's he's been wanting to uh build like a a Nerf model which is a     
5:45     
radian field model and I guess he needs you know more data ideally but I don't     
5:51     
know what his progress is on that so we'll see I mean I haven't heard from in a     
5:58     
while on it so if if someone oh I've asked two people for     
6:04     
eggs um I had a a death of one I had Calgary died po Calgary died my     
6:12     
salamanders the water in Mor is awful oh yeah and where I get the water from the     
6:19     
reverse osmosis water is under boiled water advisory at the moment so I like     
6:27     
um yeah well I had a salamander die because of your water just     
6:34     
like anyways I guess they need to search Ki for more     
6:39     
salamanders yeah anyway I have a new one I'm calling     
6:45     
her Lucy so oh yeah because a lucis     
6:50     
Lucy okay it's always you know it's always a     
6:56     
thing like with Biology experiments and biology setups that you know if your     
7:02     
water is of different quality it can be have an effect on the experiments so     
7:08     
like you know sometimes if you just like have like a a really bad part of the year in terms of uh uh pollen or     
7:15     
something you can have like a lot of I remember when we used to work in the lab in cell culture you know every year in     
7:21     
the fall and spring we'd have problems with like residue or you know like     
7:26     
getting um you know getting our cultures infected because there was all sorts of     
7:33     
stuff floating around the air I just happen to make it into the culture so your odds of your experiment not working     
7:39     
at that time were much greater and W like water you know if you don't uh     
7:45     
sometimes the source water just doesn't agree even if you filter it and just still yeah well it's reverse osmosis     
7:52     
water but they swear they hadn't uh fixed their filters recently or     
7:58     
something um I get the reverse osmosis for my house and I tend to just drink     
8:03     
the stuff that I've boiled just like this is ridiculous but     
8:11     
I just don't trust it because my salamanders died yeah I lost Calgary like she was     
8:19     
sick anyway like she wasn't that that very well yeah to begin with     
8:25     
and yeah anyways yeah     
8:33     
yeah hello dick how are you hello okay how are things going with     
8:41     
you yeah I I once tried sterilizing water with a UV uh     
8:49     
sterilizer and uh I was Raising zebra fish and they wouldn't bre turned out     
8:56     
the UV sterilizer heat a copper pipe dro driving copper into the water which made them     
9:05     
still oh no so too much of a good thing     
9:15     
yeah okay you know it's hard to win on these problems water po yeah     
9:23     
yeah well um more than water tastes wor than     
9:29     
Winnipeg water if you know what I     
9:38     
mean so yeah no iron deficiency if you drink     
9:44     
a L of water okay     
9:50     
yeah well you'll get a good um boost to your immune system if you drink our well     
9:58     
water get sick for a few days and and then     
10:03     
your immune system picks     
10:08     
up yeah oh well I'm uh yeah yeah don't     
10:17     
know at any rate hopefully I'll eventually um be allowed to show my     
10:26     
advisors what I would like to do for an experiment which is um just to image the salamander eggs     
10:34     
with the UV not UV um infrared light     
10:41     
like the optical Co tomography system     
10:47     
great anyway um I've got a whole whole bunch of slides I think I showed them to     
10:53     
you yeah maybe did I show them to you yeah yeah I think so yeah so if if I finish this uh     
11:00     
10,000w essay in good time I can and present it then I can show them the this     
11:07     
next step perhaps yeah but even if I don't do this experiment like somebody     
11:13     
should yeah yeah yeah that's     
11:19     
great yeah you can see my screen so actually yeah Susan and I have been talking uh     
11:26     
about these I guess two weeks ago we talked about how you have you know this     
11:32     
apical uh thing going on with her uh her model you know where it kind of goes up     
11:38     
I don't remember too much about it other than that right now but basically this     
11:44     
is a paper on optogenetic control of apical constriction induces synthetic     
11:50     
morphogenesis and melan tissues so this isn't epithelial cells necessarily this     
11:57     
is actually well actually is upath oal cells I'm sorry uh and they're looking     
12:02     
at they're do using synthetic biology techniques specifically with respect to     
12:08     
optogenetic control and they're uh kind of you know     
12:13     
looking at this aspect of the um the tissue an epithelial tissue in the     
12:20     
kidney so this is this tool I think they're going to talk mainly about this tool optos 3 which is an optogenetics     
12:29     
tool so you know an optogenetics uh works by if you have a a light source     
12:36     
and you illuminate a cell you can trigger different genes to be expressed in that cell so carries a marker that     
12:43     
allows it to be turned on and off by this light pulse and so there are different types of optogenetic tools     
12:50     
that they have out uh different types of light source that you can use so there's     
12:55     
the sort of control over like gene expression and U they use this in     
13:00     
organoids they also use this in other uh uh tissues uh I think they can actually     
13:07     
do it on live and behaving animals so this is not something that you know this     
13:12     
is something that's pretty diverse and can answer a lot of questions     
13:17     
potentially so let's see we have a comment oh yeah uh Morgan says there was     
13:23     
a great video released by the cc3d dev team so this is uh compy cell 3D Morgan     
13:31     
yeah yeah if you could share the link in the chat we can talk about it     
13:37     
after is yeah yeah I'm just finding the the link right now yeah     
13:42     
yeah so yeah this is uh so this paper is H talks about synthetic biology and how     
13:50     
it proposes bottomup approaches to examine the contribution of each cellular process to complex     
13:57     
morphogenesis so so they have this uh they want to investigate morphogenesis using     
14:03     
optogenetics uh it's hard to find tools to manipulate the three-dimensional shapes of mamalian tissues so you know     
14:11     
we know that from some of the stuff we've read that you know sculpting     
14:16     
tissues is possible but you know it's hard to find tools to do this so what they're going to do is they're going to     
14:22     
use an optogenetics tool to sort of shape uh they call what they call fast     
14:28     
space temporal control of apical constriction so this is where this uh     
14:34     
apical constriction uh phenomenon development is going to be under this fast spatio     
14:40     
temporal control and they're going to look specifically at mamalian epithelia     
14:45     
so this is in epithelial cells it looks like kidney cells uh they're going to     
14:50     
have I guess they're doing this in culture where they have a sheet of mdck epithelial cells and they do these     
14:59     
experiments so these is tool optu shroom 3 which is the name of it um I'm not     
15:05     
familiar with it before reading this paper so I don't know too much about it     
15:11     
um but this with when they activate uh this through illumination     
15:17     
and epithelial cell sheet this reduces the apical surface on the stimulated     
15:22     
cells and causes displacements in the adjacent regions uh maybe they'll have some     
15:29     
pictures later on we can see light induced apical constriction provokes the     
15:34     
folding of epithelial cell colonies so this is something that when you get apical construction when you can induce     
15:40     
it with light you can fold the cell Colony uh the cell sheet in they're     
15:46     
working on a soft gel um substrate so they're working on the substrate they're     
15:52     
folding the cells they're doing this in a controlled way its application to Marine and human     
15:58     
neural organoids so they're actually interested in organoid models here it's     
16:03     
application of Meine and human neural organoids so uh mouse rat and human     
16:09     
leads to thickening of neuroepithelia apical Lumin reduction in Optical     
16:14     
vessels and flattening in neuroectodermal tissues and so they they've been able to do this in     
16:20     
organoids where they have these different uh structures that are forming they're able to manipulate those     
16:27     
structures these results show that spatio temporal control of apical construction can     
16:33     
trigger several types of 3D deformation depending on the initial tissue     
16:40     
context uh a little bit of confusion here you did I hear you correctly that     
16:46     
the optogenetic uh apical constriction can lead to flattening of     
16:52     
cells uh that yeah why don't we go back let's yeah let's go back to the paper     
16:58     
I'm not sure let's see well what they were doing in this paper was that they were uh using optogenetics they were on     
17:06     
this meat on this uh substrate of uh some sort of gel and then they had this     
17:13     
uh they were able to fold the sheet of cells so this provokes the folding of     
17:19     
cell colonies on soft gels and I mean later in the paper it'll talk a little     
17:25     
bit more about it but I'm not sure if they     
17:30     
they or did they not say flattening yes Optical vessels flattening in e e tissue uh where is     
17:42     
that the bottom line bottom two three three up three up that's oh yeah the     
17:49     
flattening yeah so they yeah they did thickening of neuropath then flattening     
17:54     
in neuroectodermal tissues so these are in actually in um in this is in a     
18:00     
organoid model so this is where they have I'm not sure how they're configured     
18:06     
it doesn't make sense if you if you constrict an AP apical a cell apically     
18:12     
it should get taller not flat yeah yeah I don't know what why that would be huh     
18:21     
okay is is there an illustration of flattening well let's see yeah that's what I wanted to look at um so     
18:29     
so let's see if we yeah this is kind of the okay so this shows apical     
18:35     
construction this is the apical basil this is what actually Illustrated for Susan two weeks ago where we had the     
18:43     
cell that was hexagonal and it had the apical and the basil part and then the     
18:48     
apical construction was at the top it was kind of pulling up like that or and     
18:55     
then uh this is just showing the sort of the validation of the optogenetics     
19:00     
that's this is if it goes around a curve it it will do that okay the whole sheet     
19:08     
should curve that yeah sheet will curve when Jacobson and I observed     
19:14     
constriction the shape was not this uh conle shape uh it was a tall long     
19:23     
cylinder yeah I suppose it depends on how the     
19:29     
how the bottom and the top of the cell relate to each other um yeah yeah we also observed uh uh microtubules which     
19:37     
went from top to bottom and they might be involed yes like in some cells     
19:42     
there's microtubules on the sides our cells according to a couple of     
19:50     
things I have plas     
19:56     
okay anyway my model it actually has has that has the micral from yeah but I     
20:03     
don't see how flatting CS how flattening occurs yeah why     
20:10     
where's the where's the if you constrict the aicle end how on Earth do you get     
20:15     
flattening I think you would get curving yeah CV not flaing I agree yeah     
20:23     
yeah I don't know unless you've got um like the pseudo ified um     
20:30     
epithelium oh okay multi layered okay     
20:35     
yeah cell next to it would be the opposite shape so then it would be flat     
20:42     
yeah seems when clarification yeah they got real     
20:48     
flattening yeah well just depends like there are so so many variables with this stuff it's like that's why it took     
20:55     
10,000 words to describe it like yeah where do you start and begin     
21:01     
with it start and end yeah I don't know yeah     
21:07     
so yeah so this is just I think probably just the validation of the technique so let's see if what if they have any     
21:13     
images of like what they were doing in the um so this is actually a simulated     
21:20     
version of this sheet of tissue so these are the epithelial tissues that is a sheet so this is the sort of the square     
21:28     
that they have here the you know that they're just simulating the cells so     
21:33     
they're stimulating in a different uh time in different time courses so     
21:38     
there's group stimulation and then they have a 30 minute stimulation and then they have it     
21:44     
where they turn it off and on for like I think probably about 120 minutes so     
21:50     
about two hours that's two hours of stimulation and then they have this time     
21:55     
course to 230 minutes and they show kind of of the effects on the on the sheet of cells not just the single cells here     
22:02     
where they have let's see if I can zoom in a little bit     
22:09     
um so this is where they have the sheet of cells and they're kind of showing the     
22:15     
deformation in those in the sheet here they have kind of an example here uh and then this     
22:23     
again this is the the cell where the apical are is here the basil are is here     
22:28     
so the apical area is smaller than the basil area during this transformation so as they're stimulating the cells with     
22:35     
light the cells uh change their shape gradually and they show this after so 30     
22:43     
minutes and 150 minutes in green so the 30 minutes in purple or whatever that is     
22:49     
it's a different shape you can see it's they're overlaying the two images and so there's a there's a shift in the in the     
22:55     
cell walls um in these two images so you see here where it's kind of like in this     
23:02     
direction uh you know uh upper up and to the left and in this 150 minutes it's up     
23:08     
to the     
23:21     
right just so long as my dogs don't start barking yeah to in response     
23:29     
so yeah and then so this is yeah this is a what is this image here uh this is     
23:35     
where we have apical displacements on confluent Mones so     
23:49     
um so this yeah this is where you have this displacement they just show the     
23:55     
displacement uh so it's basically is the shape is changing the entire sheet is uh     
24:01     
changing its orientation and things are shifting around so you have the stimulated area in the middle you have     
24:08     
the adjacent areas outward and then the outer area beyond that so you can see from here that the sort of the sh the uh     
24:17     
displacements change as you go out from the stimulated area and that's all just to show that this is this technique     
24:25     
works and so that's and then they show this uh this figure here which     
24:31     
is figure three actually I think this is part of figure two I'm not sure this is     
24:37     
figure three but this is not really labeled here     
24:44     
uh oh here it is figure four uh so there's uh you can also induce Colony     
24:50     
folding and so they talk up about uh flat MDC K layer monol layers and a     
24:55     
thick matro gel bed uh uh they have so     
25:00     
the the different images of this Colony induced folding or this induced Colony     
25:06     
folding so you see here you have curvature along the edges this is the projected area so you have curvature at     
25:13     
the edges of the projected area so they're projecting light onto the sheet     
25:18     
of cells and the edges kind of curl up off of the Matel as you can see here so     
25:23     
they have this glass substrate they have the Matel substrate and then they have this the cell sheet that's on top of it     
25:30     
and it's curving up at the edges of the stimulated area and so you can see that     
25:35     
they're showing how it can change its shape it curls up basically in the     
25:41     
apical Direction I guess after 24 hours so zero hours it's kind of flat 24 hours     
25:48     
it's curling up like this so you see this curvature     
25:54     
there and so I don't know what if they mean by flattening they mean that it's it stays on the matro gel or if it's     
26:02     
curling up versus not curling up or what they mean by that it could be an artifact of the way     
26:08     
they're doing these     
26:13     
experiments so let's see um so a possible explanation for these differences is the specific tissue     
26:20     
geometry and availability of cytoskeletal components in each SE for of each cell type as the interactions of     
26:28     
the extracellular Matrix so opto optos 3 activation Pro provokes the recruitment     
26:34     
of non-muscle meas and 2B to the apical Junctions all it has been reported that     
26:40     
shroom 3 can induce a redistribution of uh tubulin to cause cell elongation     
26:45     
along the apical basil axis we did not find a change in the distribution of microtubules and NDC cells or Optical     
26:53     
vesical organoids upon opter 3 activation so     
26:59     
they're uh So based on their uh 3D cell segmentation and their model that     
27:04     
they're using for modeling some of this it suggests that opos 3 induced apical     
27:10     
constriction could itself be enough to explain cell elongation through cell volume conservation consistent with     
27:17     
previous studies and so yeah this is uh then this is the final figure I think     
27:26     
uh this shows the Optical vessel organoid vesicle organoids so these are vesicle organoids for the optic cup I     
27:34     
guess uh this is day Zero you have matri it'ss a matri gel this is day four you     
27:41     
get this neuroepithelium start to form it goes off and it starts to thicken uh and have like this apical and     
27:49     
basil aspect to it and then day six it forms this shape here where it forms uh     
27:56     
Optical vesicles at the edges of this uh sphere and then you get shrinkage within     
28:03     
each of these vesicles and an apical and a basil aspect to it as well after day six so this is kind of showing this um     
28:13     
how this is their experiments in the in the organoids this is a Imaging of the     
28:19     
organoids this is one of the vesicles here this vesicle shows up     
28:25     
uh they they kind of zoom in on it here they show the optical stimulation they     
28:30     
show sort of before stimulation which is in purple so there's a certain shape     
28:36     
before stimulation then after stimulation there's a shift in the shape     
28:41     
so if you see this semicircle right here in the vesicle the the purple at the     
28:46     
edge is where it starts and then after 55 minutes it kind of contracts down to     
28:52     
where this is here so you see the green uh semicircle so there's a shift in the     
28:58     
in the shape over that time um this shows neuro human     
29:04     
neuroectodermal organoids so this is day Zero where you get this have this human     
29:09     
stem cell aggregate or plur potent cell aggregate uh this is day Zero at day     
29:16     
five you get neural induction you get the basil and apical aspect and then day six to seven they say there's flattening     
29:22     
so what they mean by flattening here is where you stimulate the cells and     
29:27     
uh after as neural induction is happening at day five you get this     
29:33     
flattening of this shape uh so you get a flattening in the sheet uh in this in     
29:38     
this orientation along the edge of this Naro acadm so you see the flattening     
29:44     
instead of it being uh this yeah so this shows a little bit more in a little bit     
29:50     
more detail the surface curvature decreases as the neuroectoderm is     
29:56     
stimulated and then this shows the expected curvature before stimulation     
30:01     
and after stimulation so this is curvature and micron's     
30:07     
uh power of negative 1 so it's like the fraction of curvature then orientation     
30:13     
or fraction of microns and then orientation in degrees so this is a very     
30:18     
small number here this is uh degrees and orientation so along this curve and this     
30:26     
is uh so this is 150° negative 150° so you're looking at about 300° of this     
30:33     
orientation and then you have this where there's the stimulation in this blue bar     
30:40     
here and you can see that that's where most of our change is happening in the     
30:45     
in the shape in the curvature uh where the curvature is decreasing so for example before stimulation is the blue     
30:53     
line which is pretty much you know around this mean curvature uh inverse curvature of     
31:03     
0.006 and then you have the red which is 1 hour of stimulation so you see after 1     
31:09     
hour of stimulation the area that's not being stimulated is more or less     
31:14     
consistent with what happened what the shape was before stimulation there's some shifting of the sheet you know here     
31:21     
and there but where you see the treatment where this stimulation is happening where the white is being     
31:28     
shined in this uh in this very small sort of aperture you get this big     
31:35     
difference in one hour of stimulation the curvature decreases I guess significantly if they     
31:42     
don't really Define what that means but you see this big departure from what was     
31:47     
happening before stimulation so again you get this flattening that happens as     
31:53     
a result of stimulation this flattening of the epithelia wheel sheet it's kind     
31:58     
of pushing you know inward or it's flattening or something like that and you see it's a a product of the white     
32:05     
stimulation and not just happening at random so that's     
32:13     
um so that's all they have really uh maybe of Interest here uh they used IPS     
32:20     
s lines for their inputs so these are you know     
32:26     
uh I don't know if that's going to make a difference in terms of they use the     
32:31     
MDC cell lne uh for a lot of these experiments     
32:36     
but they also use Mouse esls and human ipss so I had okay this is the link to     
32:44     
the uh cc3d stuff um this is the YouTube video yeah     
32:50     
and then the more uh this more relates to software engineering of complex computational modeling projects     
32:57     
like compy cell 3D yeah Morgan and I have been talking about compy cell 3D um you know kind of uh in a some     
33:07     
conversations so yeah this is something we tried to do a while back but it's I I don't know maybe the learning curve is a     
33:14     
bit high for some people to learn how to use it but Morgan you know I don't know     
33:19     
what your thoughts are on that I think you need to kind of you know when if we want to do this we have to kind of     
33:25     
develop a way to you know get people ramped up and you know maybe try some     
33:31     
because they have a lot of example model systems that right but they've got they've got great worked you know     
33:37     
embryology examples yeah they do you and um um yeah it's really just uh getting     
33:44     
through well yeah any any project um with it is is very much a software     
33:51     
projects you know yeah like a software development project and uh um you know a     
33:59     
maybe a little bit more than just a scripting project if see what I mean yes     
34:04     
but it was this what was nice about this video was that it seemed like somebody     
34:11     
you know took an hour and 45 minutes to go through how to how to work with the     
34:17     
code base and you know and uh and with GitHub you know and like sync sync with     
34:25     
their with their development tree yeah it was nice so is that compucell     
34:32     
3D yeah yeah this um is it James Blazer um or leads that Indiana     
34:42     
University and he does um well he he does obviously um a lot of biology but     
34:50     
but also Network Dynamics um yeah very very multidisiplinary     
34:59     
I just wondered if it was something I should include in in modeling of cells     
35:06     
because I I have to write a section I still haven't on how to do um modeling     
35:13     
with tensegrity of of cells and so there's some stuff done in     
35:21     
that lab um and uh don't know I think he's I     
35:29     
think he's like one one level um I mean     
35:35     
it's a lot about um s simulations just looking across     
35:41     
like a student simulations they're they're usually not so much you know of the finite element     
35:48     
sort um although they they've talk sometimes about integrating that but um     
35:56     
but very much like what are what are simplifying assumptions we can make to deal with either     
36:03     
multicellularity and or you know they do pandemic modeling you know they do um uh     
36:12     
you know very very generic modeling as well right so um you know infection and     
36:19     
things like that where things are things are transmitted and um and pass you know     
36:25     
passing through barriers and I'm being really generic because that's the kind of stuff     
36:32     
you know whether it's like it's like tissue modeling as well as you know population     
36:38     
modeling uh does that make     
36:43     
sense okay but he he does do I mean he     
36:48     
definitely does do yeah so it's just if if I was modeling a     
36:54     
cell again like uh uh yeah I just need to know what what     
37:01     
the what the problem was but um you know like the 3D seems to be in its name or     
37:08     
the the kind of you know spatial aspects of of     
37:13     
multicellularity like seemed to have been a an early um Development Goal okay I need I need     
37:22     
to look at this then oh okay yeah I mean it's like it's Embry ology like he's     
37:27     
definitely got some great worked examples I've been looking at yeah yeah     
37:33     
well that's the biology that I know embryology thank you dick     
37:40     
um I I know um normal physiology as well having taught     
37:47     
it and um I don't know cancer biology as well as I know others     
37:55     
so sorry interesting so if it's got embryology in it that's fine I     
38:01     
can just go with that yeah yeah well but um you know again in kind of like the Le     
38:10     
uh leev work um compy cell 3D would be     
38:15     
good for for cancer modeling too in the sense of     
38:22     
um well I'm not sure actually so if it's a breakdown     
38:28     
multicellularity well again I I bet you he's got worked examples I just haven't looked them up yet     
38:36     
yeah I mean there some Lan was     
38:41     
doing Michael Levan yeah was has just been talking about how his work um you     
38:49     
know the the plaria that he's working with or he has some of his examples are     
38:56     
are using um see you know seem to be cancer resistant or you know are     
39:02     
Immortal and and practically cancer resistant like they can they can you     
39:08     
know raise them in you know incredible toxicity uh and you know the the animals     
39:17     
seem fine um so it but in particular his work seems to be focused on how the role     
39:24     
of electricity in multi cellularities uh collective intelligence     
39:29     
or you know Collective U uh in multicity     
39:37     
socialism like communicates communicates electric electrically or you know how     
39:43     
what role it plays especially in in its um spatial     
39:48     
uh spatial heterogenity differentiation right so you know like     
39:55     
like how how he can play with um you can play with uh you know some of the the U     
40:04     
receptors and and pumps to to reconfigure an organism's     
40:11     
you know spatial spatial organization right well it does have I know um     
40:18     
epithelial cells run on um calcium um     
40:25     
just like muscles do because it has a acoas and ring     
40:31     
okay the top part of it apal part of     
40:37     
them except in some exceptions um it's on the apal part of cells it can can     
40:45     
apparently be um somewhere else in some specialized cells um and it's an     
40:51     
actomyosin ring it's non muscle mein but it's still iasin so you     
40:59     
tramps that's interesting yeah I mean so as is um he doesn't just focus on on     
41:08     
those those creatures but um you know he's he's even got like an     
41:13     
active startup working on regenerating Mouse     
41:19     
LS oh okay so I need to have a look at that too this is not for my 10,000w     
41:27     
essay this will be for confused professors so they'll leave me alone um     
41:33     
later well I think it's definitely good for the you know like the the future     
41:38     
applications U you know kind of section if you can relate relate your work to to     
41:44     
the things that Levan's doing it's h he's doing working in so many cool     
41:49     
active um uh research topics you know this is the guy who put together the     
41:55     
with Josh bong um you know the living robots or you     
42:00     
know like is it zenopus cells yeah yeah the xenobots yeah yeah the xenobots yeah     
42:07     
yeah yeah um so you know again just um     
42:12     
uh you know really really interesting applications of really fundamental     
42:18     
biology right and and you know compy cell 3D is     
42:26     
is is great and seems to be like a tool that that lends itself to kind of leav     
42:32     
like simulations but uh but he's actually got some really cool software projects too you know that that really     
42:39     
focus on the kind of cellular nonneuronal cellular um     
42:46     
bioelectricity okay does he get into mitochondria uh now like like like again     
42:52     
like his his work is very I don't want to say abstract     
42:57     
because like he'll do things that are so you know such like incredible living     
43:03     
demonstrations too but but the software is pretty pretty abstract like like     
43:09     
Betsy which is is um you know electromagnetic simulator you know 2D     
43:16     
simulator um is is still very very removed from any kind of biology you     
43:23     
know but it's it's a again like interesting demonstrations of of yeah     
43:31     
like I I think he has it just because neuronal simulators aren't aren't of of     
43:38     
interest to him he wants you know he's really trying to do something different I'm it's just     
43:47     
I'm an electrical engineer by like that my foundation so I'm more interested in     
43:53     
the circuit and what's right and you know simulators like     
43:59     
neuron um which is a you know old school C++ package for doing you know reaction     
44:06     
fusion simulations and allowing you to do kind of low-level um neuronal     
44:14     
simulations yeah like like he he knows that that exists uh yeah so I think I think that's     
44:22     
why he does things a little different simulators but uh uh his     
44:29     
paper's worth looking at you know like he works in so many different areas is     
44:35     
it toughs yeah Michael 11 is that is that toughs yeah oh wow okay I know somebody     
44:42     
else that Ts that I want to go there me me too me     
44:51     
too and that's some TS he has a nice um     
44:57     
program for doing simulations oh yeah so we seem to be really into     
45:04     
that um okay H name is Timothy um and I'm     
45:12     
losing his last name here starts with an a um anyway um I just just dropped a     
45:20     
link for embryonic segmentation I think with compell 3D you know so like again I     
45:28     
mean I was saying this um Saturday you know the the wealth of material from     
45:33     
glazers group is just amazing you know he's got all his courses     
45:39     
online which I will say Josh bongard does too uh but uh yeah glaz's got all his     
45:47     
his courses online all his student presentations you know the work they've done uh as well as they do an annual     
45:55     
Workshop in summer school um you know just just to cover the software okay     
46:02     
well there's there's a program out there called Moro oh yeah yeah and that looked     
46:11     
interesting if you if you've got a link there's a lot of packages with Moro as a     
46:16     
name okay yeah all right if it's particular     
46:24     
um my only problem with it is I downloaded the whole thing got everything     
46:31     
downloaded except the last line of code and it     
46:37     
wouldn't it wouldn't     
46:42     
download yeah I was saying to Lucas that one of the things I like to do just to     
46:48     
get my you know feet wet so to speak is um as package package software for for     
46:55     
for Fedora so that yeah people don't have this problem it's as easy as you     
47:01     
know installing any other software they don't have to build it they just yeah blad the     
47:11     
RPM what theora never heard of it uh it's the it's like uh it's like Debian     
47:18     
for auntu it's like the you know yeah it's Linux but it's like it's the it's     
47:24     
the development version of Linux for red hat or you know that's that's what the     
47:31     
fodora people would like to call it okay and it was the 20th 20th     
47:37     
anniversary so it's um I'm feeling particularly     
47:43     
old yeah that's not when I started using red hat but that's just when Fedora     
47:48     
started oh I tried to put this on my lovely Windows machine and the Inu line     
47:55     
the last line for Moro it just won't take okay yes so send me a link     
48:05     
what's the where's this from um toughs oh it's from TOPS oh wait wait     
48:13     
wait I think you did point me to this before wait     
48:20     
yeah all right right no it's coming back to me now okay well just need my glasses     
48:26     
yeah yeah yeah put your email and I'll send you what I know oh yeah no no I I'm     
48:32     
on their GitHub now yeah yeah I've already got it saved right small edible language for     
48:40     
scientific yeah just seriously annoying okay and I'm not very good with command     
48:46     
line programming right and this is this is typical where it's like somebody's     
48:52     
written their own their own tool but that that it's basically using Bloss lapack and sweet spars in the back     
49:00     
end oh okay can you they're doing what yes it's just     
49:09     
um yeah well I think I I think I had a look at this before but yeah it's     
49:20     
all yeah and this is the kind of stuff you know     
49:26     
this is the kind of stuff that um they were covering in this video that     
49:33     
uh glazers group released was you know play playing with the code base and you     
49:39     
know looking at the dependencies um what what happens when you update the     
49:45     
dependencies what what what breaks and and how to merge that tree it was very     
49:52     
cool okay well anyway my computer doesn't seem to want the     
49:59     
code the L so but this on and you're on a you're using a buntu yeah it was a     
50:11     
buntu I don't know what that is yeah yeah yeah I'm familiar with a     
50:17     
lot of obscure software oh scary software     
50:24     
yeah well that's great yeah thanks Morgan for     
50:30     
the uh discussion about the uh copy cell 3D okay I do you have a question oh yeah     
50:40     
no I just wondering more about um programming at cups um yes yes I'm just     
50:48     
uh just looking at that now since my daughter seems to not want to go to     
50:54     
school today oh I'm not sure she has an actual excuse     
50:59     
I think it's just a preference okay as long as it's not a     
51:05     
reason yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly as long as it's just a whim     
51:12     
right uh but um yeah in terms of Morpho     
51:18     
or um yeah sure Moro and other types of     
51:25     
that deal with cells um well I mean copy cell 3D is the thing to look at you know     
51:32     
I mean Morpheus is this other package that um that I was looking at yeah um     
51:39     
and I like I I'm pretty sure you know it's from the high performance Computing     
51:45     
group in Dresden but I'm pretty sure it's because Dresden is the site for the     
51:52     
um German government's focused uh like like splits you know their MOX plunc     
51:57     
centers into Specialties and um stem cell is is the is dresden's focus or you     
52:05     
know like one of the centers MOX Blan centers is the stem cells is there so     
52:11     
it's doing it's got a lot of worked examples yeah compucell 3D and and     
52:18     
Morpheus comp yourself 3D is from Dron no no no no that's from Indiana     
52:26     
and and Morpheus is from from morus yeah and the     
52:34     
moro yeah Moro I'm looking at now and um and looks like a     
52:41     
a you know like honestly it looks it's it's a lot like mat lab in that it's a     
52:48     
it's kind of a a language a scripting language on top of Blossom laac on top of what     
52:56     
um well they're using numerical libraries that U were developed     
53:01     
by a lot of people a long time ago at National     
53:08     
Labs mostly out of um Tennessee I think I believe     
53:16     
um oid oid yeah yeah     
53:21     
yeah okay looks like they've got a make file     
53:26     
you're looking at oid uh no that's just um sorry just     
53:32     
giving you more more detail than you need here that's okay you're looking at what     
53:40     
um just going into the morpo uh Source directory Moro 5 is where they say to     
53:50     
go and uh and then they've got a make file     
54:00     
let's see if this runs um I don't know why it thinks it     
54:08     
needs um well I just want to make I don't want to install it oh now that would be good too I tried     
54:17     
to install it well so um I I'd want to check this     
54:24     
particular I'd want to see I like to see a file that before it uh before it at request     
54:33     
you know super user access well I was talking to Timothy     
54:39     
Alber from TS and okay had him I have his email he he was trying to help me     
54:46     
with it um and like I said it got down to the last line and it just wouldn't take it like I'd type it in and then it     
54:54     
would erase itself s erase itself that's pretty     
55:00     
remarkable it has something to do with my     
55:07     
computer is is that what he told you no that's what I'm okay computer is a     
55:14     
little different it's not our code it's your computer yeah yes it could be so many software     
55:21     
Engineers have said that okay all right well it was     
55:26     
working that that I can believe um so yeah I need to see um a little bit more     
55:35     
about um I mean it looks like you build two projects one's called morpo 5 which     
55:41     
I assume is the the language and then um and then you build morpo view which is     
55:48     
obviously the viewer um uh yeah Oro view that I I was having     
55:57     
trouble and that that they're both they're both trying to put stuff into um     
56:02     
user local which um you know is does take me     
56:11     
back     
56:16     
um that's that's quite quite again quite old school these days like     
56:23     
yeah um this can easily be changed if a different location is preferred so yeah     
56:29     
let me um um I gotta head out and get kids to     
56:35     
school but uh I'll have a look at this when I get back and um I'm sure we can     
56:42     
get this built but you you did you say you're on a buntu yeah     
56:48     
okay but is that um you're doing a buntu inside windows yes     
56:55     
gotcha so your windows subsystem for Linux yes gotcha gotcha but but the     
57:02     
abund to you know like semi semi supported um one two yeah okay whatever     
57:09     
say that's all I yeah they they um they apparently have     
57:15     
a an app for specifically for     
57:20     
that um okay well I did install it per     
57:26     
directions and like I said the last step on the what the     
57:32     
view um maybe for the viewer yeah Moro view the last     
57:40     
line wouldn't wouldn't take so how can I run the thing this is     
57:47     
like um let me just uh my ma problem with any programming that I do is     
57:53     
installing the software in the first place that is the main     
58:00     
hangup with it I can usually figure out how to do it after that but installing     
58:07     
it no yeah well this is and and you know you're making a great case for why why     
58:14     
packagers Linux packagers do the work they do it's h for exactly this     
58:21     
problem so yeah I'm um I'm immediately getting a problem um with uh     
58:31     
uh I'm immediately getting a problem with the viewer oh yeah     
58:38     
gfw so um yeah I need to look at uh how     
58:43     
old this project is because um you know I I am I am running at least I'm     
58:49     
building this on Fedora I I've got an auntu system that I use for     
58:55     
yeah just to keep things saying um uh but uh yeah I'll have a look at this     
59:02     
later and and get back to you do I have your email Susan well I can get it     
59:08     
from yeah yeah yeah but happy happy to look at this but but     
59:15     
curious of what you're what you're hoping to get from it like is it because it's they have like worked examples or     
59:23     
um okay all right yeah I want to um put     
59:30     
my design of epithelial tissue into it it just um and then run     
59:38     
it from there but but what what do you get from that I mean in the sense of I     
59:44     
get the hopefully get the matrices that are behind running it like some of the     
59:53     
the math because yeah I asked commo well can I see some of the matrices with the     
1:00:03     
produc they laughed at me all I got was a laugh they who who laughed at you     
1:00:10     
anyway uh I'm like trying to do a PhD here I need the ma and what Tex support was laughing at     
1:00:19     
yeah something like that I okay yeah I it was during one of their um     
1:00:24     
presentations where you could ask any question ah okay wow wow wow they are     
1:00:34     
they that's uh that's coming from a place of privileged umh if they're gonna     
1:00:39     
laugh at you in front of publicly usually when people laugh I've asked an     
1:00:45     
impossibly hard question I've done that well in this case it's just that they're they are a closed stor you know they're     
1:00:52     
a proprietary uh um company you know Co codebase and     
1:00:58     
um you know there there are finite element solutions that are that are open     
1:01:04     
source to give you you know that you can then get at any of the intermediary     
1:01:10     
representations you want um uh but but then they become much more you know it     
1:01:17     
becomes again like more of engineering project potentially potentially um uh     
1:01:26     
this is um yeah well I'm curious what they're using here but um yeah let me give it     
1:01:33     
some some attention when I get back thank you very much thank you for I've     
1:01:38     
got I've got your email and um well we've talked about uh we've talked about Phoenix before um so this is Fe ni I     
1:01:48     
CS um as you know that that was there there's a number of of find packages and     
1:01:57     
communities where you know like um how do they spell Phoenix again yeah     
1:02:05     
F ni I CS so yeah and um that's that's one um     
1:02:15     
that that that was what we used for for our kind of finite elements     
1:02:21     
electromagnetic electrical impedance demography     
1:02:26     
uh uh head modeling um but you know but I had a you know an engineer programmer     
1:02:33     
working on it who was like a trained particle     
1:02:39     
physicist yeah yeah so and you know he was working with with with but he was     
1:02:46     
getting a lot of advice and and help from the community     
1:02:52     
um um and uh what's the other     
1:02:58     
um uh I think it's get DP     
1:03:05     
um is the um is what um so like again     
1:03:11     
like I'm just drawing from from examples electromagnetic Imaging but or Electro     
1:03:17     
electromagnetic head modeling um so there's a package called Sim nibs which is used for like TMS and Tes modeling     
1:03:25     
and it it's using gesh and um so that's gmsh and get DP which is you know     
1:03:36     
another pretty sure get DPS from um a really good group in     
1:03:44     
Le but uh you know these are used for for modeling you know Electronics     
1:03:52     
or electrical equipment um I think the getp developers w a     
1:03:57     
Google prize of like making their data center Power Systems like 10% more     
1:04:04     
efficient or something like that you know because like if you can make you if you can make Google's Power Systems 10%     
1:04:12     
more efficient you save them like you know 20 billion dollars or something lot to that I yeah yeah it's     
1:04:20     
like I know about building electronics and electricity     
1:04:25     
electricity that's the Fielding in in as an electrical engineer like you know     
1:04:32     
something about it uh I want to say I was saying all of that sight unseen but     
1:04:39     
um is it yeah yeah yeah it's definitely um yeah it's the get DP guys that won     
1:04:45     
the Google won the Google thing um but that's still very you know this is a     
1:04:51     
Super Active project right um uh it's a lot like the um how to     
1:04:58     
stabilize your electrical system for instance when there's a um spikes coming     
1:05:05     
into your system from your hydro and um motobus Hydro is spiky because it     
1:05:13     
converts from DC to AC the last step yeah yeah yeah so um yeah I've seen     
1:05:23     
a lot of uh um a lot of that kind of modeling and um from the Julia folks     
1:05:30     
actually modeling modeling big electrical networks you know power for     
1:05:35     
states and countries and stuff but um anyway I've got to take off um I will be     
1:05:42     
in touch via email thank you yeah no problem and I dropped a link for get DP     
1:05:49     
okay yeah I've I've got it I captured it yeah yeah yeah they're they're they're     
1:05:54     
great right yeah take care thanks thanks for bye bye bye all right now I'd like     
1:06:02     
to cover an additional paper and this one is actually a theoretical paper on     
1:06:09     
morphogenesis but it ties into the epithelial paper we were talking about     
1:06:14     
earlier in the meeting this paper is called a mechanism based theory of cellular and tissue     
1:06:21     
plasticity uh this is from a Chinese group uh in     
1:06:27     
pnas and it's let's go through the significance uh section first so the     
1:06:34     
significance is that cells and tissues are known to undergo significant plastic     
1:06:39     
deformations during many biological processes and they was cell migration     
1:06:44     
tissue regeneration organ development and morphogenesis so beside from     
1:06:50     
morphogenesis there are a lot of these plastic type deformation that occur so     
1:06:55     
these can occur in adulthood or these can even Ur in development independent or     
1:07:01     
morphogenesis however at this juncture there is still a lack of comprehensive theory in the field so they developed     
1:07:07     
this mechanism based Theory uh that accounts for all key processes involved     
1:07:12     
and achieves quantitative agreement with all existing experiments which I don't think it's all existing experiments     
1:07:19     
necessarily but they kind of give a you know they have to sell it some     
1:07:25     
our Theory not only provides a fundamental understanding of how plasticity is initiated in individual     
1:07:31     
cells and then propagates tissue within tissues but it can also be used to guide     
1:07:36     
the design of strategies for regulating biological processes such as tissue     
1:07:42     
formation and morph embryogenesis so this is again there very well within what we've been talking     
1:07:49     
about with respect to epithelial sheets and some of the uh     
1:07:54     
sort of the movements and migration patterns in morphogenesis or in     
1:08:01     
embryogenesis um so the the abstract gives us a little bit more     
1:08:07     
detail so again plastic deformations in cells and tissues and that's how they're     
1:08:12     
defining their area so it's not just about morphogenesis or embryogenesis     
1:08:19     
it's about these plastic deformations and so the fundamental     
1:08:24     
question here is how plasticity is initiated in individual cells and then propagates within a     
1:08:31     
tissue so you know the way they view it is that you have plasticity as a     
1:08:37     
property of the individual cell whereas maybe an internal property of the cell     
1:08:43     
that is maybe it's a matter of gene expression or a matter of uh the cell's     
1:08:49     
uh Behavior within a sheet or within a collective of cells uh and then that those changes or     
1:08:56     
plasticity propagates within a tissue so it goes from a single cell to multiple     
1:09:01     
cells and so I you know I don't know if that's necessarily a good way to view uh     
1:09:07     
plasticity but it is one way so to State this another way if you     
1:09:12     
have a single cell and let's take our epithelial sheet for a moment we'll take a single epithelial cell     
1:09:19     
here and it has internal properties which would be you know some sort of     
1:09:25     
gene expression so we might have a genetic regulatory Network or it could be the properties of the cell the     
1:09:33     
biophysics the point is is that they're talking about single cells and maybe this is a case where you have a network     
1:09:39     
of cells or you know individual single cells maybe in parallel so you consider     
1:09:46     
single cells but in parallel but cells are almost always embedded in some sort of larger system     
1:09:53     
so let's say that we have a sheet of epithelial     
1:09:58     
cells and each of these cells are operating independently you know we'll just give     
1:10:05     
them all sort of an internal model of uh some sort of plasticity so you     
1:10:12     
know they might have each have a switch where they go from one state to another state where there might be a generalized     
1:10:19     
PL a plastic response that you know is triggered in each cell     
1:10:25     
independently but as cells that are coordinated say in a sheet you have these coordinating     
1:10:33     
factors and they could be like signaling or some     
1:10:39     
other uh you know type of switch that would synchronize so you     
1:10:45     
have cell signaling and cell cell communication and those individual     
1:10:52     
signals would become synchronized so that that plastic     
1:10:57     
response is uniform across the sheet and so that's maybe what they're arguing that's that would be my sort of     
1:11:04     
take on this argument is that you know plasticity May originate in individual     
1:11:10     
cells but it also needs to be synchronized in some way and it's you     
1:11:16     
know it could propagate in the in the in the classic sort of agent based sense or     
1:11:22     
cellular automat sense where a single cell has effects on its neighbors and     
1:11:27     
then those neighbors have effects on their neighbors and so forth but I think that that you have to     
1:11:32     
consider that sort of uh Collective response so this is they say themselves     
1:11:38     
a mechanism based Theory which is great um we need more mechanism based Theory but we also need     
1:11:44     
to link it with Collective Behavior type theories or emergent uh     
1:11:51     
theories I think mechanism based and emergent based theories are maybe you     
1:11:56     
know hybrid theories are probably the way to go here so they talk about a mechanism     
1:12:01     
based theory of cellular and tissue plasticity that accounts for all key processes involved including the     
1:12:08     
activation and development of active contraction at different scales so you have these different scales of     
1:12:14     
contraction active contraction as well as the formation of endocytic vesicles     
1:12:20     
on Cell Junctions so you know we talked about vesicles earlier in terms of being     
1:12:25     
deformed uh due to different types of optogenetic stimulation so certainly if     
1:12:31     
you have cell cell communication the vesicles are going to play a role in that and being able to deal you know     
1:12:38     
sort of modify the confirmational shape of those vesicles then plays a role in some of that uh extracellular     
1:12:45     
communication or iner communication so they talk about how     
1:12:52     
their Theory achieves quantitative agreement um you know that that's     
1:12:57     
important in theories but of course it's not the only thing sometimes you know we     
1:13:03     
want theories that maybe don't agree with every piece of evidence because we     
1:13:08     
want something that's overarching and you know not every experiment's been done so you know we want to have open     
1:13:15     
some open areas of inquiry uh we want to be able to cter it     
1:13:20     
in a theory we want to be able to cter in it very generally and explain not only the experiments that have been done     
1:13:26     
but those that are going to be done in the future or even counterintuitive results that might change the face of     
1:13:34     
what we know so actually here they point out that you know you can use Optical or     
1:13:40     
mechanical stimuli to mod to sort of probe the cells the myosin contraction     
1:13:46     
and thermal fluctuation assisted formation and pinching of endocytic vesicles so they focus on out indic     
1:13:53     
vesicles could lead to permanent shortening of cell Junctions and that plastic constriction can stretch     
1:13:59     
neighbor cells and Trigger their active contraction their mechanochemical feedbacks and eventually their plastic     
1:14:06     
deformations as well so let's map this out um I'm going     
1:14:12     
to map it out then I'm going to show you the board so what they say here is that they I     
1:14:19     
want to look at this I want to underline this draw this out then show you what we're talking about here so they     
1:14:26     
have op some Optical or mechanical stimulus and this is of course     
1:14:32     
a input to the cells each cell so every cell is going to have this input and     
1:14:40     
then we talk about mein contraction so there's a cell you have vesicles on the     
1:14:47     
sides those are being Modified by this stemulation you have cytoskeleton which     
1:14:54     
is being Modified by the stimulation you have a so     
1:15:01     
modification modification and so you have these and so this is permanent shortening of cell     
1:15:08     
Junctions so these cell cell Junctions that happen between cells you have a shortening the     
1:15:16     
modification of the cell Junctions and then plastic Construction     
1:15:22     
Construction cells and Trigger their active contraction so you have opposing     
1:15:27     
forces between cells and then you have another cell I'm going to draw two cells here and just     
1:15:36     
kind of in a sheet of cells through mechanochemical feedbacks so these     
1:15:41     
modifications are feeding back on each other eventually they're plastic deformation as well so this is my     
1:15:48     
drawing here it's not very good but you can see that you have the stimul was coming in you have these cells a     
1:15:56     
neighbor cell which is kind of half shown and the main cell which is down at the bottom you have all these sources of     
1:16:02     
modification you have the sheet of cells on the left with feedback and that those     
1:16:07     
are the mechanochemical feedback so this process on this cell down here is     
1:16:13     
happening in every cell simultaneously or maybe not simultaneously that's you know uh maybe a thing that you think     
1:16:21     
about in a theory where you know you make the Assumption say that everything is happening simultaneously but of     
1:16:27     
course it may not be happening simultaneously it may be happening in a way that's uh asynchronous and so we     
1:16:35     
have to consider that as well but you have these general mechanochemical feedbacks which are of course um you     
1:16:43     
know it seems like magic right I mean you say something is a magical feedback     
1:16:49     
and you know it's obviously now a collective Behavior but these feedbacks     
1:16:54     
you know work at different scales and in different ways so you might for example stimulate the cell you might change the     
1:17:01     
shape of the vesicle it might uh affect uh gene     
1:17:07     
expression or cell cell communication in some way you might modify the cytoskeleton and the acting uh filaments     
1:17:15     
in the cytoskeleton and it modifies the shape of the cell which can modify the     
1:17:20     
cell the Gap Junctions and other types of interfaces with other cells and these     
1:17:26     
can happen differentially across the sheet of cells so that when you have a sheet of cells and we'll go to a draw     
1:17:33     
sheet of cells here these are these epithelial cells that they have these     
1:17:40     
like properties along an axis that result in maybe some sort of     
1:17:48     
uh uh critical event that happens so for example if you have enough forces going     
1:17:53     
in One Direction you might end up being able to slip a cell out the cell might     
1:18:00     
start to come out in this direction and these other cells might end up coming together there are other types of     
1:18:06     
collective behaviors that might happen uh for example you might have uh you     
1:18:12     
know deformations where the sheet splits in two or other types of things that might     
1:18:19     
happen so there're all sorts of things we can use sort of a mechanistic Theory to explain um now whether the     
1:18:25     
mechanistic theory is the best way to do that is of course you know up to the reader to     
1:18:32     
decide so this is kind of what they're saying their theory predicts that endocytic vesicles with a size of around     
1:18:39     
one to two microns will most likely be formed and a higher irreversible shortening of cell Junctions could be     
1:18:45     
achieved if a long stimulation is split into multiple short ones so they're really getting very uh well mechanis IC     
1:18:53     
I guess you could say and they're kind of predicting these very small components and how they contribute to     
1:18:59     
larger cells and then ultimately the behavior of cell collectives uh and so all in     
1:19:06     
quantitative agreement with experiments uh so they they they come up with this     
1:19:11     
Theory based on experiments but also based on sort of you know what they think is the optimal size for this our     
1:19:18     
analysis also shows the construction of cells and tissue can undergo elastic un     
1:19:23     
ratcheted to plastic ratcheted transition as the magnitude and duration     
1:19:28     
of active contraction increases so as there's contraction in the cell uh you have these what they     
1:19:35     
call ratcheted Transitions and ratcheted at least as far as I     
1:19:41     
understand it and there are different types of Ratchet mechanisms that theists have used there's of course the Muer     
1:19:47     
ratchet and there other types of adaptive ratchets we're basically Chang change happens in One Direction so a     
1:19:55     
ratchet is allows you to sort of move things in One Direction and then locks out movements in the other direction so     
1:20:02     
you move a ratchet you kind of move things forward and then it locks and then you put it back on and you move it     
1:20:08     
forward and it locks so it's this one-way process and so elastic in their     
1:20:15     
estimation is unret which means that elastic changes can be uh they don't     
1:20:21     
have any directionality so things can stretch or things can expand things can     
1:20:26     
contract and there's no long-term memory for that there may be some uh hysteresis     
1:20:32     
in the system where things get sort of uh you know things can return to their     
1:20:40     
uh can't return to the original state but this is not uh directional you know     
1:20:45     
it's not meant to be directional as opposed to plasticity which is ratcheted     
1:20:51     
which means that something goes in One Direction so plastic responses often are adaptive in a in a way that improves say     
1:20:59     
like the uh dynamic range of the cell where it improves the sort of increases     
1:21:05     
in size or decreases in size there's a directionality to the change and it's     
1:21:10     
not just simply hysteresis where you have this it can't return to its original state it's very much     
1:21:17     
intentional to provide an advantage to the cell and maybe into the     
1:21:24     
organism so they said that there's this uh sort of transition from elastic un     
1:21:30     
ratcheted to plastic ratcheted transitions as the magnitude and duration of active cell contraction     
1:21:36     
increases so as active contraction increases uh this magnitude and     
1:21:43     
duration uh then there's this transition ultimately resulting in the propagation of plastic deformation waves within the     
1:21:50     
monare with a constant speed which again is consistent with experimental observations so there are these plastic     
1:21:57     
deformation waves so plasticity is propagated throughout the monol layer     
1:22:03     
and you get this these changes so they point out that uh     
1:22:10     
tissues organisms organs and organisms assume complex three-dimensional geometries throughout     
1:22:16     
morphogenesis that large numbers of cells deform and move in a highly coordinated and programmed manner     
1:22:23     
uh mounting evidence has demonstrated the capability of cells to undergo irreversible     
1:22:29     
deformations individual or collectively referred to as cellular tissue plasticity so they Define this sort of     
1:22:36     
Ratchet this plasticity ratchet     
1:22:41     
um mechanistically plastic deformation of cells involve various events across different length scales so at the     
1:22:48     
subcellular level you have lipid vesicles that form and and then pinch away from the cell membrane so they kind     
1:22:55     
of pull away and they this is what they call endocytosis uh effectively resulting in     
1:23:02     
a plastic strain in cell surface so as these vesicles form they kind of pull on     
1:23:07     
the surface of the cell they do different types of deformation and then you have things     
1:23:13     
going on at the tissue level plastic contraction of individual cells can     
1:23:18     
activate Collective contraction of their neighbors Cooperative constriction something that cannot be achieved by     
1:23:24     
elastic cellular deformation or competitive constriction so this is something that where you have this     
1:23:30     
Collective contraction versus just simple cellular deformation things     
1:23:36     
happening in different cells competitively in in the sheet versus things that where the cells are     
1:23:42     
cooperating to have this sort of collective movement this eventually     
1:23:47     
initiates molecular and deformation waves within the tissue triggering its more Genesis leading to the formation of     
1:23:54     
spatial patterns so they talk about 32 and 33 and I'm interested to know what     
1:24:00     
these molecular and deformation waves are that they're referring to so citation 32 and citation     
1:24:08     
33 this one here 32 is genetic induction and mechanochemical     
1:24:14     
propagation morphogenetic wave and we've talked about morphogenetic waves is uh     
1:24:20     
something that maybe needs to be viewed ically uh then 33 is control of     
1:24:26     
osteoblast regeneration by a train of irk activity waves and these are uh     
1:24:31     
electrochemical waves that occur in uh so this is a expression of ir and this     
1:24:39     
is an activity wave trains of activity waves that are associated with that uh     
1:24:46     
then you know there's some other nice citations in here uh we should go through these citations at some point     
1:24:52     
this would be very useful um let's go to the figures so figure one here shows I know     
1:25:01     
what they're talking about here here are your vesicles and I drew them on the outside of the cell but they can happen     
1:25:06     
you within the the cytoplasm they come up to the surface and they sort of deform the cell in different ways and so     
1:25:13     
this is where the the vesicle itself is regulated in terms of its size and how it's pinched off by these dynamin     
1:25:20     
molecules and here they act in filament and the cytoskeleton which can also push on this uh     
1:25:27     
vesicle then you have one plastic cell in a sheet of cells so this plastic cell     
1:25:32     
can do its own thing which is uh competitive or can act in concert with     
1:25:37     
other cells which just cooperative and so this is an example here of things happening at the tissue     
1:25:45     
level the cellular level and the molecular level again their focus is on     
1:25:50     
mechanism but they're kind of generalizing to uh Collective behaviors     
1:25:55     
which you know may or may not be like particularly useful if you're trying to     
1:26:00     
understand things at multiple scales um this shows like where you have     
1:26:06     
mechanical stimulation by strain or Optical stimulation by light and these     
1:26:11     
activate signaling proteins in inside the cell so this is at the nanometer     
1:26:17     
scale at the Micron scale you have these different forces acting on the cell and     
1:26:22     
then at the millimeter scale you have these sheets of tissues where you have multiple cells interacting at their     
1:26:28     
interface so this is the tissue level you have these aspects of uh cellular     
1:26:36     
mechanics you have the cellular level you have plasticity mechanisms membrane     
1:26:41     
tension and vesicle formation then at the molecular level you have signaling molecules molecular recruitment so     
1:26:49     
recruiting other molecules into macro molecular complexes and then contraction     
1:26:55     
so this all contributes to cell Stream So this just shows like how cellular     
1:27:00     
plasticity acts across scales and again you need some sort of multi-level model     
1:27:06     
or some sort of hybrid model to do to treat this in terms of modeling and in terms of even understanding the problem     
1:27:16     
fully figure two shows uh modeling contraction thermal     
1:27:22     
fluctuation assisted formation of endocytic vesicles so you see the vesicles here where you have this uh the     
1:27:29     
length of this surface element here uh in in B at the top then the next image     
1:27:37     
shows bending so there's this uh bending at an angle it subtends at a certain angle and it pulls up the sort of the     
1:27:43     
edge of the vesicle and then the vesicle forms as this uh semi independent thing where     
1:27:51     
it's tied together by the dining on the on the at the base and then eventually     
1:27:56     
this vesicle gets pinched off so the dining pinches off the neck of the     
1:28:02     
vesicle and it floats off as something carrying like molecules or something     
1:28:07     
else and moving away from the cell membrane in vesicle breaking that's the     
1:28:12     
Dinan that breaks apart and the vesicle sort of gets Unbound and then uh shrinks     
1:28:18     
back into the membrane so this is these are dynamin uh you know serves to sort     
1:28:26     
of regulate this process you have these all these potential vesicles on the edge     
1:28:31     
of the cell they break off and move Inward and they they're involved in signaling but they can affect the the     
1:28:38     
shape of the membrane so you can see this where you know you have this active     
1:28:44     
process of dynamin uh the uh actin uh     
1:28:50     
filaments and the vesicles all acting together so you have this process of of     
1:28:57     
formation you have this process of stimulation okay so a lot of this paper     
1:29:02     
is focusing on the mathematics of sort of cellular physics and it's talking     
1:29:07     
about the formation of vesicles it's also showing some of these uh     
1:29:13     
stimulation experiments where you stimulate some cells in the center and     
1:29:18     
they affect cells on the periphery so you have these illuminated cell cells unilluminated cells and then this     
1:29:24     
boundary stress of the uh community of cells so like lot what we saw in the     
1:29:30     
paper uh earlier in the meeting where we have this Focus you know we have light     
1:29:36     
stimulation where we focus a light in a certain place and it has an effect and in that case they we're using     
1:29:41     
optogenetics in this case I think they may also be using optogenetics um but you can actually     
1:29:48     
have different types of light stimulation independent of optogenetic the control isn't necessarily there but     
1:29:54     
it may have an effect on the cells with respect to the other cells and so they show some graphs here     
1:30:04     
uh so they they trigger something by light at at the zero minute Mark and     
1:30:11     
then they show the Dynamics of these different things so uh our graphs are uh     
1:30:16     
we have uh simulated length evolution of Junctions under a single five minute     
1:30:22     
10 minute 20 minute and 40 minute uh length so this is where we have uh 10     
1:30:29     
minute 20 minute uh 40 minute and 60 Minute     
1:30:35     
intervals and so you can see that there's a a little bit different time course where if you have increase this     
1:30:41     
window of exposure so from this in B it's five so you can see the Shaded area     
1:30:47     
of five minutes where there's this Junction length that shortens and then rebounds and of course as it rebounds it does not     
1:30:54     
exhibit hysteresis as it retains its length of one and then in C you have     
1:31:00     
this stimulation of 10 minutes in the Shaded area so you have this stimulation     
1:31:06     
process the junction length goes down but then there's significant hysteresis after the light stos is removed with uh     
1:31:15     
20 minutes you see a similar result and then with 40 minutes you see a similar     
1:31:21     
result where there's this significant hysteresis and non-recovery and it's you     
1:31:27     
know actually uh the junction length shorten significantly in this case and     
1:31:33     
then in F you have this pulse of 20 minutes and 20 minutes where you see     
1:31:39     
this where if you pulse it over time you pulse it you have a light pulse you     
1:31:44     
remove the light pulse you add the white pulse again then you remove it you get this serial uh hysteresis where you have     
1:31:52     
a junction length of one it decreases to about 65 or 7 it rebounds to about 08 so     
1:32:00     
there's some rebound but there's still hysteresis and then you stimulate it again and there's hysteresis on top of     
1:32:08     
that so you have two hysteretic events that occur in a staggered fashion and it     
1:32:13     
really can reduce the junction length so light stimulation can affect these     
1:32:21     
factors     
1:32:28     
um and so then you in GH you have normalized myosin activity over that     
1:32:34     
same time period so myosin ramps up as the junction length decreases and then     
1:32:40     
myosin length actually exhibits no hysteresis because it rebounds over the     
1:32:46     
20 minutes back to its original activity of zero and so you know it's not     
1:32:52     
stimulating any background myosin activity uh then the junction tension     
1:32:58     
which is in Nano Newtons you can see that there's this drop with the     
1:33:03     
treatment there's this kind of noise and then it drops off and then it rebounds to its original here uh actually the     
1:33:10     
junction tension increases a little bit as the treatment is removed and this is in the uh puls regime so you have these     
1:33:18     
pulses that decrease the junction tension but the Junction tension rebounds so this is just some example of     
1:33:26     
how they can break down a single process and get measurements of it and say things about     
1:33:36     
it so this is showing a phase transition during the initiation and propagation of     
1:33:42     
cell plastic City in figure four and these graphs are kind of showing the the     
1:33:48     
uh the phase it's a they're phase portraits of these different variables     
1:33:54     
uh so contraction amplitude versus normalized time uh you see that there's this     
1:34:00     
plasticity that increases as contraction amplitude     
1:34:05     
increases but also over time and then the contraction amplitude with time     
1:34:11     
there's this adjacent cell contraction so you have a central cell and this     
1:34:17     
figure d subfigure d shows this so this is the central cell and this purple and     
1:34:23     
this uh the adjacent cells are in sort of this lighter color and so what you     
1:34:30     
have basically is the central cell has this plasticity and the adjacent cells are doing things in response to that so     
1:34:36     
in the competitive mode you have single cells that are interacting with its neighbor cells and they're influencing     
1:34:43     
their neighbor cells their neighbor cells may be responding to that whatever the central cell is doing or might be re     
1:34:50     
reacting to in another way uh in the competitive mode it's basically the     
1:34:56     
central cell that's the main driver of everything in the Cooperative mode you have adjacent cells which can be the     
1:35:02     
drivers as well and so they're cooperating versus competing and so you can imagine that they're all these cells     
1:35:08     
can be Central cells at the same time they're just in a different mode of interaction they may be competing with     
1:35:14     
one another as opposed to cooperating and so you can see that in this case you     
1:35:20     
see that over time time the contraction amplitude increases in the central cell     
1:35:25     
the plasticity increases and this has an effect on the adjacent cells so the     
1:35:31     
adjacent cells will contract the contraction amplitude will increase over     
1:35:37     
time and the adjacent cell plasticity ultimately then will increase over time     
1:35:43     
because it's being forced by the central cell in E you see that there is this     
1:35:49     
these ratcheted and unret regimes GES so with contraction     
1:35:54     
amplitude uh you know over time initially it doesn't have any effect it's uncontracted so you know it's just     
1:36:01     
kind of neutral and then over time you start to get these amplitudes where you     
1:36:07     
have this unret regime so it's kind of perturbed and it's responding to that perturbation ultimately though this is a     
1:36:14     
ratcheted form of change so you get this directional change and it's really with high amplitudes over time that ampl ude     
1:36:21     
can be lower it can be almost a little bit above 0.5 but you can see that there's this     
1:36:27     
process of it being unaffected versus having this almost like Brownie and noise going on to some sort of     
1:36:34     
directional ratcheting of plasticity and so that's what they're doing here they're talking about this phase     
1:36:40     
transition where you go from like a state of quiessence to a state of sort     
1:36:45     
of um you know sort of response or reaction to this then state of plasticity and so this this figure talks     
1:36:52     
about propagation in a tissue so all these uh hexagons are individual cells     
1:36:59     
and so you can see that they've simulated this where over 25 minutes where you have a parameter cell tension     
1:37:05     
and Nano Newtons and it's basically propagating out from a central cell or a central set of cells so you can see it's     
1:37:12     
zero minutes we have nothing going on at 2 minutes the C cell tension in the central cells is is uh lower than the     
1:37:20     
surrounding cell and then as we move through time that area spreads so the cell tension drops     
1:37:28     
as we I guess there there's Cooperative there Cooperative interactions going on     
1:37:33     
and over 10 minutes 18 minutes and 25 minutes 25 minutes almost the entire     
1:37:39     
sheet has lower cell tension and the center actually has a little bit higher     
1:37:44     
cell tension than the edge the Leading Edge here so there's a propagation along the front that's concentric and     
1:37:51     
spreading outward and so that's what they're showing here so they they conclude by talking about uh sort of the     
1:37:58     
how this model can be applied so although by revealing mechanisms by which mechanical plasticity is initiated     
1:38:05     
and propagated the cells so now they're very specific and talking about mechanical plasticity so it's not just     
1:38:12     
about uh generalized plasticity it's about this mechanical plasticity um uh this work enables a     
1:38:20     
major advant and our understanding of important biological processes such as tissue formation wound healing     
1:38:27     
Collective cell migration and embryogenesis so it's not just developmental it's any kind of plasticity but it's mechanical     
1:38:34     
plasticity that they focused on here in addition the model developed here may also provide critical insights for     
1:38:41     
applications like the formation of synthetic extracellular vesicles and organoids so they throw organoids in     
1:38:47     
there as a way to S you know sort of generalize Theory uh we talked about     
1:38:53     
organoids earlier in the meeting and other meetings where you know there are these challenges the modeling organoids     
1:39:00     
the question is are organoids like a developmental system or they maybe have their own properties that are     
1:39:07     
necessarily like a developmental system in organoids you're often dealing with cells that transition from some sort of     
1:39:13     
stem cell- like State slar potent state to a a certain cell type but those cell     
1:39:20     
types aren't necessarily the same cell types that you might find in biology so it's an important point to think     
1:39:27     
about finally by incorporating more features such as the plasticity induced curvature of cell layers so they didn't     
1:39:33     
include curvature in these models it's just like a flat sheet of cells as we saw with the epithelial cells uh     
1:39:40     
anisotropic boundary conditions of tissue so you know they're different uh conditions of different port portions of     
1:39:46     
the sheet so you might be like on one side of the sheet versus the other they different boundary conditions and     
1:39:53     
reversible pinching and breaking of vesicles which you know you can have this pinching off of vesicles and they     
1:39:59     
might float away but they might also come back down redock and and kind of be resorbed into the uh membrane these     
1:40:07     
sorts of things might happen as well it is conceivable that the present Theory can be extended studying interesting     
1:40:13     
phenomena like threedimensional structure in tissue pattern formation of cells and the hyperelastic responsive     
1:40:20     
active mat materials so this is all kind of where how they're generalizing their     
1:40:25     
Theory so thank you for paying attention I hope you learned something
