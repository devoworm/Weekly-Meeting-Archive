hello hello I guess my microphone is on yeah     
0:06     
yeah how are you um well I got my model to work good     
0:13     
at least uh one of the hexagons to work so it's easy to make a three or seven     
0:21     
hexagon model from that because you just copy it okay so     
0:28     
I'm maybe by this Friday I will have something or Thursday I guess yeah is     
0:36     
what I need it for I ran into something interesting     
0:41     
here just now it says cell mechanics dissecting the physical responses of     
0:48     
cells to force and it is a     
0:55     
2009 so I didn't know about this okay so I     
1:00     
guess I guess I get to read that     
1:06     
yeah and then there's one called computation of the effective mechanical     
1:13     
response of biological networks accounting for large configuration     
1:18     
changes so that's a good one yeah do you want the reference yeah put     
1:25     
them in the chat okay because this this one on uh     
1:30     
biological networks um I I'm GNA have to look look     
1:36     
at it closely and it includes some lovely math of course oh     
1:43     
yeah anyways yeah put those in the chat     
1:50     
actually the first thing that uh wanted to mention was that we had the annual meeting for openworm this past week so     
1:58     
that was that was pretty good actually we had a lot of the people who uh you know are regular senior     
2:05     
contributors there we have a board of directors is also there and I presented     
2:10     
on some of the things you've been doing in D.A worm and they were kind of excited they was excited to hear about     
2:16     
it so I don't know if they're gonna like if there's any uh sort of collateral uh     
2:22     
benefit of that we'll see um but that's yeah so that was     
2:28     
successful um I also did a presentation on the YouTube channel that kind of went     
2:35     
in more detail I only had like five minutes at the meeting but I had 30 minutes on the video so that's up on the     
2:41     
YouTube channel um and then I'm going to be getting out a video on dvo learn and     
2:49     
like a longer form sort of state of the project where we are on that so it should be     
2:58     
good hello dick how are you oh     
3:04     
hi so yeah there are your two references so the first is from     
3:11     
2015 computation of the effective mechanical response of biological networks     
3:17     
accounting for large configurational changes that's so this is like displace     
3:25     
like geometric displacements or mechanical displacements yeah it's um I haven't looked at it too much     
3:32     
but it's certainly is along the lines of what I have to look at so y That's good shows a deformed beam     
3:42     
and yeah only it's looking at a red blood cell     
3:49     
um which is not something I wanted to get     
3:55     
into yeah there's a red BL cell and something else     
4:00     
H got something a fourfold connectivity and six-fold     
4:06     
connectivity and so intermediate filament Network and     
4:11     
it's a lattice Square lattice no they don't feel like     
4:17     
that oh well so they they have uh this fourfold     
4:25     
and sixfold does that mean that it's just connected to four other things six other things is it like those yeah um     
4:33     
the fourfold is just the squrl onus and the sixfold is     
4:39     
triangular a triangular type Rus oh okay and don't know you see     
4:48     
that okay not good uh yeah okay I see it now one two three four five six yeah     
4:55     
yeah so it's six coming together yeah six is the triangles in it yeah which is more     
5:04     
that would work better with a finite element analysis situation because that's what um that's what it always     
5:12     
does to your drawing so this is the first paper Susan showed the picture of     
5:19     
the uh this four-fold and sixfold connectivity in mechanical networks so     
5:26     
that's where you either have four squares that come together at at a point     
5:31     
or six triangles that come together at some point and this is in this first     
5:36     
paper computational the effective mechanical response of biological networks     
5:41     
accounting for large configurational changes and then okay comment on that I     
5:48     
think Wayne broadland did a paper a long time ago on those uh uh forces at those     
5:57     
Junctions I don't recall when name of the paper try to look it     
6:05     
up all     
6:11     
right yeah and then uh the second so that was the first paper and when I saw     
6:18     
large configurational changes I wonder two things uh one you know are they kind     
6:23     
of getting moving towards entropy I guess or configurational entropy and     
6:28     
then second um you know you're talking about large changes to network so you     
6:34     
know what are the conditions under which those changes occur or what is that you     
6:40     
know that's some sort of dynamic dynamical uh modeling and Susan was     
6:46     
talking about how you know we might use I'm showing Susan's mute button on oh no     
6:54     
yeah looks like you're muted Susan     
7:03     
and so yeah then the other thing is that uh you know it we were talk Susan was     
7:10     
talking about um fin an element analysis and some of the things she's explored     
7:16     
with that but yeah it's it's looks like an interesting paper um the other one is cell mechanics     
7:25     
dissecting the physical responses of cells to force and that's uh biomedical     
7:31     
engineering annual review in 2009 so that's uh again I guess that has     
7:38     
a lot of interesting things in it I don't know uh I haven't read the paper so I don't     
7:47     
know okay uh so that's great thank you Susan for those and so yeah you're working on your     
7:54     
paper that you're going to present soon in public     
8:00     
good luck on     
8:06     
that     
8:14     
okay oh yeah you're muted I can't hear you you want to type it in the chat     
8:21     
that's fine but all     
8:26     
right me share my screen I have some things other papers to go through     
8:31     
so     
8:39     
um yeah so there's been some interesting work uh all right let's see what Susan oh yeah there there's Wayne     
8:45     
broadland papers an epithelia oh the system is muting you yeah I don't know     
8:53     
why but we have a bunch of citations here on uh     
9:01     
epithelial cells yeah so these are all like     
9:07     
biophysics um you know some other things related to     
9:13     
embryo movements and things like that that's I don't know which paper it     
9:19     
was there's so many yeah     
9:27     
yeah all right thanks for that um so first thing I wanted to     
9:34     
mention is that there was a uh there's been a lot of interesting work on nuclear     
9:39     
modeling and uh you know some things that have come out recently where people are modeling the     
9:45     
nucleus um so this paper here is a it's a sort of a prize essay from a graduate     
9:53     
student um this is uh priz I think it's science uh jur Journal yeah science and     
10:01     
they gave they had like a contest for people to write an essay about their work so this is a prizewinning essay on     
10:08     
this work here this is uh Imaging nuclear architecture in single cells     
10:15     
Yodi te is his name and U so this is uh you know using multiplexed     
10:22     
Imaging and so this is uh done to uncover precise three-dimensional maps     
10:28     
of single nucleus so this is his PhD work I don't know if it's been published or not but it's     
10:34     
pretty close so uh the smallest functional unit in our bodies the cell is spatially     
10:40     
organized with various molecules including DNA RNA and proteins studying     
10:46     
the subs silar organization of molecules and individual cells is fundamental for     
10:52     
understanding diverse cell types and States uh from neurons to cancer cells     
10:57     
so you know we want to know know something about how the cells are organized within the cell body     
11:04     
itself um and so the cell's nucleus a highly organized membrane bound organel     
11:11     
that contains genomic DNA and UK carots is closely linked with complex Gene     
11:17     
regulation uh reviewing its three-dimensional organization is of considerable interest     
11:22     
to a wide range of fields including developmental biology human disease     
11:27     
Neuroscience uh um and so the first sort of nuclear     
11:34     
structures were uh sort of observed by Ramon kahal using light microscopy in     
11:41     
1910 and now we have modern genomics and Imaging Technologies so we still don't really     
11:47     
have good uh direct measurements of the spatial organization we have a lot of good uh genomic data we have a lot of uh     
11:56     
good you know like we have microscope SC slices but we you don't have a lot of the 3D architecture or at least it's     
12:04     
hard to get really precise measurements of the 3D architecture and then of course in this group we talk about 4D     
12:11     
architecture which is plus time so I mean a lot of these things are sort of     
12:16     
time is implicit in them so you know we can we can think of time as as a thing there too but what they're interested in     
12:23     
is building like a 3D model almost or data that would allow you to populate a     
12:29     
model of the nuclear architecture and so and then this you     
12:34     
know this allows you to look at Gene regulation the whole process of Gene regulation you know it's not just like     
12:41     
you know the cartoons that we have in our textbooks where we have uh something binding to something else there's a     
12:47     
three-dimensional structure to that and some of that three-dimensional structure     
12:52     
regulates what happens so this is you know this is kind     
12:58     
of where it gets into how they're doing this uh Imaging um and so you know it's a a     
13:05     
pretty big challenge uh so the ability of to     
13:11     
connect 3D chromosome organization and transcriptomic information within individual cells     
13:17     
would greatly Advance our understanding of Gene regulation so to this end he codeveloped intron sequential     
13:24     
fluorescence in SCU hybridization or what they call seek     
13:29     
so this is fluorescent inc3 hybridization but a certain type of it     
13:34     
uh this allows you to use microscopes to profile transcripts at the transcriptome     
13:40     
scale so you can look at transcripts within the cell uh seek fish works by constructing     
13:46     
temporal barcodes and single RNA molecules through sequential rounds of hybridization and imaging fluorescently     
13:53     
labeled probes and then nent transcripts appear near their genomic Loi we can     
14:01     
profile transcriptional activities and chromosome organization in each cell so it's you know taking advantage of how     
14:08     
this process works spatially and you know being able to get the right imaging technology to work and then getting that     
14:16     
those it basically it's Imaging data and translating that into some sort of a and     
14:22     
some sort of a model so you know they they worked on this     
14:27     
method seek um they were able to scale up this kind of profiling to the transcript Tome     
14:34     
scale so looking at multiple genes and multiple transcripts and this opened the door to     
14:40     
Discovery driven single cell spatial transcriptomics so this is where we have a single cell we can look at the spatial     
14:47     
distribution of transcripts and so this is uh they were     
14:52     
working with mouse embryonic stem cells uh and in in those cases nent RNA     
14:58     
synthesis tends to occur at the surfaces of individual chromosome territories     
15:03     
whereas relative positions of chromosomes in the nucleus are variable so this is where you have this AR     
15:11     
synthesis uh occurring near the chromosomes so this is within the nucleus and then the relative positions     
15:18     
of chromosomes in the nucleus can be in different places so you basically can ID the positions of chromosomes by these     
15:25     
signals uh that are associated with n and RNA synthesis um and so this these kind of     
15:33     
transcripton profiles accurately capture differences in cell States so     
15:38     
interestingly if you have Flur potent States or cell a cell within cell cycle     
15:45     
you can you know do different interventions to sort of synchronize cell cycle or identify different periods     
15:52     
of cell cycle or identify this plur potency state of the cell so they worked     
15:58     
in embryonic stem cells but you can also work in other types of cells and     
16:03     
different states of differentiation to get different you know     
16:09     
profiles um so then you know you want to to understand the nuclear architecture you need to record the organization of     
16:15     
chromosomes including non-coding regions and then simultaneously compare     
16:22     
them um between uh with higher order spatial res relationships between     
16:28     
chromosome structures nuclear bodies chromatin States and transcriptional     
16:34     
States within a cell and so this is where they developed the spatial genomics     
16:39     
approach um so this is some of the figures here this is     
16:45     
uh where they they did this method seek fish and so they're looking in a a     
16:51     
single cell they're looking inside the nucleus so this is five microns of scalebar so we're dealing with a pretty     
16:58     
small system um and we have these we do sequent sequential rounds of Imaging and     
17:05     
we get these profiles where we have these marks you know in in the image and     
17:10     
those are just the fish uh profile and so you can see that pattern here the     
17:17     
idea is that these the signal will correspond to the chromatin where wherever it is in the in the nucleus and     
17:24     
so you can reconstruct things like that and then this is is a a sort of a a     
17:31     
color false color model of some of this so this is the nucleus in a mouse     
17:36     
embrionic stem cell this is now this is actually the nucleis so we're dealing Now with uh different uh so this is the     
17:45     
nucleis of the M embrionic stem cell you have 20 chromosomes 15 subnuclear     
17:54     
structures uh this actually down here this is the nuclear I'm sorry so this is the nucleus of the mouse embrionic stem     
18:00     
cell uh this is chromosome one so they've been able to localize chromosome 1 and chromosome 3 so you can see that     
18:08     
you have this they know from like a genome sequence what where that chromosome is in the genome sequence and     
18:16     
they can localize chromosome one because they can take the uh they know the transcriptomics they know where some of     
18:23     
these things are so they can map out different chromosomes chromosome one is here chromosome Z 3 is in these regions     
18:30     
and so you have this um this is this is what they're getting     
18:36     
so then this is the nucleis stain this is the RNA polymerase 2 stain these are     
18:42     
the nuclear zones so this is actually where you have these structures within the nucleus you can see here you have     
18:49     
these blue areas these are nucleis Barney polymerase 2 which is the     
18:55     
part of the transcriptional Machinery you have these uh spots here it's hard to see in this comb merged image but     
19:02     
down here you can see it and then nuclear zones are here and then this is uh looking at uh     
19:11     
diverse cell types in the mouse brain so this was in stem cells so they were     
19:16     
looking in stem cells but then if you look at different types of cells you can see that if it's an inator neuron an     
19:23     
excitatory neuron or an asterite different the nucleus is structure differently so in the     
19:30     
inhibitory neuron you have this I guess this is nucleosis maybe and it's in     
19:36     
different places uh the RNA polymerus is in different places and so the     
19:42     
implication is is that it's uh it's it's placed in different transcriptional states perhaps I don't know exactly but     
19:49     
it's definitely suggestive that there's a different transcriptional profile which we already knew but I mean you     
19:55     
know this is kind of uh confirming kind of what that looks like so this you know     
20:00     
this is a first passet this I guess of modeling and so it's really interesting to see because I mean there a lot of     
20:07     
questions you might raise from this um you know um so it's it's definitely     
20:13     
something that you can merge with other types of trans like uh spatial transcriptomics to get interesting     
20:20     
answers to questions and so we're at the very beginning of this Imaging based single     
20:26     
cell multi omix era anticipate an explosion of Imaging based single cell multiomics in the coming years in     
20:33     
combination with Advanced computational modeling approaches that will accelerate the discoveries of fundamental     
20:39     
principles in single cell biology and Beyond so that's uh that kind of work so     
20:46     
that's one example and then this is um different this is the mechano biology of nuclear     
20:52     
phase separation so this is a review article from 2022 and you know in this paper they're     
21:00     
talking about um the nucleus and they're looking at the     
21:06     
mechanobiology of the nucleus so in the last paper they talked about the transcriptomics of the nucleus and kind     
21:12     
of profiling that in this paper they're talking about the mechanobiology so the cell nucleus can     
21:19     
be thought of as a complex Dynamic living material so we think about the cell but we don't you know the nucleus     
21:26     
is also this kind of thing which functions to organize and protect the genome and coordinate gene     
21:33     
expression so again the nucleus is cordinating gene expression it's protecting the genome and it's     
21:40     
organizing The genome as well these functions are achiev VI intricate mechanical and biomechanical     
21:47     
interactions among its Myriad components including nuclear lamina nuclear bodies     
21:52     
and the chromatin itself and so while the biophysical organization of the nuclear lamb     
21:58     
and chromatin have been thoroughly studied the concept that liquid liquid phase separation and related phase     
22:06     
transitions play a role in establishing nuclear structure this has been sort of     
22:11     
emerging recently as a a thing to think about um you know we think a lot about     
22:16     
the biophysical organization of Chromatin and that's been studied in the nuclear lamina but then there are these     
22:22     
things like liquid liquid phase separation and other kinds of phase     
22:28     
Transitions and you can see in the data uh in the previous paper that you have     
22:34     
these different sort of profiles spatial profiles for different things going on     
22:40     
in transcription so you know you have uh different spatial locations of Things     
22:46     
Different spatial locations of uh chromosomal products and things like that so these things change of course     
22:53     
when the cell State changes and so if that's the case then there must be     
22:59     
something else going on there there must be dynamics that go from one cell type to another and so what are those look     
23:06     
like and obviously maybe kind of know why it may be obvious but how that     
23:12     
happens is not really clear and so these phase transitions may be very     
23:18     
important phase transitions are likely to be intimately coupled the mechanobiology of structural elements in     
23:24     
the nucleus but their interplay with one another is still not understood here we review recent     
23:31     
developments on the world phase separation and mechanics in nuclear organization and discuss functional     
23:37     
implications in cell physiology and disease States so this is definitely     
23:44     
um you know kind of a different a little bit different take on it but I think it's useful because it has a lot of the     
23:50     
sort of gives us the sort of another perspective to the other paper so you know we're talking about the nucleus     
23:58     
what regulates gene expression but then also what kinds of structural aspects of the nucleus are important not only for     
24:05     
that but for like differentiation and as a whole so this you know shows sort of these phase     
24:12     
separation mechanics and nuclear organization so we have these multiphase     
24:17     
structures here we have visco elastic uh viscal elastic environment so we you     
24:25     
know have something that is of that physical property it restricts condensate growth so you don't have     
24:32     
condensates you you have this area where things can move around at different places in the     
24:38     
nucleus you have the nuclear lamina which is the sort of the outside boundary and there you have lamin and     
24:45     
chromatin nuclear bodies inside the lamin hold it in and so this is you know     
24:51     
a porous structure but also it has the structure on the outside that serves as a boundary and of course as things     
24:59     
constantly move around he needs to be flexible to move with those things and then this is UK chromatin and     
25:06     
heterochromatin it's sort of like this web inside and so this is showing     
25:11     
examples of this where the heterochromatin is dense more densely packed than the UK     
25:18     
chromatin and then this is these are regions of the coordinated chromatin movement so there's some synchronization     
25:23     
of Chromatin in the nucleus uh as it's moving around     
25:31     
so yeah they get they get into some of the mechanics uh they do some     
25:37     
microbiology you know they're doing some different things with the nucleus they're able to use micro pipe     
25:45     
manipulations aspiration and then Atomic Force microscopy where they apply a force uh to the nucleus in the measure     
25:53     
this is a force versus extension graph you have strain stiffening you have the     
26:00     
spring constant and then you have strain softening so you have these different physical properties of the nucleus if     
26:06     
you uh you know perturb the nucleus in some way uh you can induce forces that     
26:13     
kind of reveal the uh the properties of the the material here so um that's     
26:21     
that's something that's been done um this is just showing the single particle     
26:27     
tra in that you can use here so they have sub diffusive diffusive and super     
26:33     
diffusive uh behaviors all in the nucleus so this is where you can get a     
26:38     
sense handl on the viscosity of things by looking at how they diffuse through the nucleus so sub diffusive just means     
26:46     
that it's very you know maybe there's a very viscous fluid diffusive is maybe     
26:51     
neutral and super diffusive is less viscous um and so this just shows on a     
26:56     
log log scale what that looks like okay so we have some things in the     
27:02     
chat here uh any mention of chromal linkers I     
27:08     
didn't see that in either of the papers are nuclea the two cells of the     
27:13     
same kind similar um that I don't that could be maybe not we don't know I guess they've     
27:20     
I don't know how many they've observed like whether it I don't think it's been well characterized for a cell type so if     
27:27     
you have a stem cell you know it might look very different from like stem cell     
27:33     
type to stem cell type so if it's an embryonic stem cell or a bone stem cell you know there are different types of     
27:38     
stem cells that we can look at it's you know I mean I think this is kind of like     
27:44     
a first pass at it so um and then you know of course they've observed     
27:50     
differences with other cell types but you know I don't know what those differences mean other than that they're     
27:56     
different so so uh so Susan says uh strain stiffening     
28:03     
I was told happens in steel when carbon is incorporated into the iron     
28:08     
yeah yeah so they they I guess they quench it I guess that would be the term     
28:14     
or not well anyways yeah they or they dope it I guess with something so they     
28:20     
they put something in it change the properties of the     
28:26     
material and then I have a diagram showing ventin incorporated into actin in that way     
28:38     
yeah okay I find the     
28:46     
reference like dick is typing     
28:56     
something okay so that's that's kind of discussing     
29:01     
Visto elasticity uh FAL elasticity it's it's     
29:07     
an important uh property of the nucleus but again we don't know a lot about like     
29:13     
you know the absolute Dynamics here it's just kind of people when exploring     
29:20     
this um so let's see so despite the power of these approaches passive     
29:26     
microbiology General requires that the material being studied is homogeneous in     
29:31     
an equilibrium so that can be a problem in a lot of cells where you have like in     
29:36     
developmental context where you have things changing uh and so yeah we can't really     
29:43     
look at heterogeneity and out of equilibrium activity is it's not as reliable of a     
29:48     
method um so you can do different types of micrology uh but it's hard to to     
29:56     
implement uh so in human cells it's been shown that chromatin exhibits adenosine     
30:02     
triphosphate dependent Micron scale Dynamic correlations that's ADP dependent Micron scale Dynamic     
30:09     
correlations similarly chromatin displacement has been shown we highly heterogeneous with particle image uh     
30:17     
veloc uh velocimetry suggesting that the local viscal elastic elasticity of the     
30:22     
nucleus varies by compartment so this is where we get different     
30:28     
properties across the nucleus depending on sort of How It's compartmentalized uh despite these     
30:34     
confounding aspects of a typical cell nuclei zenopus slavis oite provide     
30:40     
simpler contrasting examples so this is in zenopus uh mature zenopus o sites are     
30:47     
around 1 millimeter in diameter and relatively homogeneous featuring a low chromatin     
30:53     
volume fraction so less chroma I guess maybe the less chromatin the more homogeneous although I don't know if     
31:00     
that's true or not that's just kind of seems what may be the case analysis of     
31:06     
the MSD of beads injected into the oite nucleoplasm compared with active micro     
31:11     
reological measurements of beads sedimenting through the nucleoplasm under Gravity so they're kind of testing     
31:17     
the sort of the viscosity here and the you know they're making these     
31:23     
different microbiological measurements suggest that this particular system is not strongly out of     
31:29     
equilibrium so you know we have to kind of think about how much out of equilibrium a certain nucleuses to sort     
31:37     
of get a sense of how accurate our measurements may be     
31:43     
um so let's see uh in addition to suggesting that the chromatin network is     
31:48     
highly viso elastic subd diffusive motion of nuclear components has been the subject of much experimental and     
31:55     
theoretical study due to the relevance of the first passage time or genomic search problem so inside the crow of     
32:03     
nucleus critical processes may be limited by the time it takes for two Loi     
32:08     
to diffuse into proximal locations so this is where you have this in the     
32:13     
crowded nucleus things are moving around and it takes time for things to move to     
32:19     
different locations or to diffuse so I showed those examples of sub pred or uh     
32:24     
you know sub diffusive diffusive super diffusive uh you know profiles     
32:31     
where it either moves just a tiny bit around its origin it moves kind of in a healthy bronan motion or it's really     
32:38     
kind of moving in all different locations uh very very diffuse from where it started that's what they're     
32:45     
talking about that it takes time for that kind of diffusion but it may be heterogeneous as well so this kind of uh     
32:53     
you know these critical processes may be limited but you know these are things     
32:58     
that happen so this is uh including enhancer promoter interactions and homology search during homology director     
33:05     
repair of DNA double stranded breaks so the the sort of the larger scale changes     
33:11     
in the nucleus can be affected by uh diffusion and then diffusion itself can     
33:16     
be affected by these different uh types of activities going on uh in the     
33:24     
nucleus in addition recent workers suggested that chromatin May lie near a sole gel transition to facilitate a     
33:31     
transition to Rapid liquid like Dynamics and functionally required and that DNA     
33:37     
damage May derive directional motion of Chromatin that's interesting uh so this     
33:43     
may not be just kind of a a stochastic process it may be driven by certain     
33:48     
things going on in the nucleus certain     
33:53     
functions the presence of liquid like nuclear condenses May facilitate this genomic search and we know that either     
34:01     
although condid sets are sort of inhibited here they can still occur um enhance transcription by     
34:09     
providing an environment with rapid liquidlike Dynamics which have been observed coupled to     
34:14     
transcription that's reference 49 or excluding non-specific bul chromatin     
34:20     
that's reference 50 so they they've done a lot of like kind of review of the literature on this there's a lot of     
34:26     
stuff suggest in that you have these different maybe specialized mechanisms that occur that um you know optimize     
34:35     
different processes in transcription so this is interesting um together this     
34:41     
evidence may suggest that condensates play an important role in spatially organizing chromatin so I think we've     
34:47     
talked about condet before so they can actually organize chromatin they're not everywhere in the nucleus but they do     
34:54     
exist and they do serve this kind of maybe adaptive function and regulating     
35:00     
the viscal elastic properties of the local environment of the nucleus although their role in the maintenance     
35:05     
of both material properties remains unclear so you don't know how it     
35:11     
actually regulates you know how the like if you were to do some sort of micro     
35:16     
reological probe how that would change the behavior of the nucleus could it     
35:21     
become more um you know rigid or would it become more     
35:28     
flexible or whatever so yeah this this kind of talks about     
35:34     
you know more about this     
35:43     
um yeah so this kind of talks about uh phase separation so you have these     
35:49     
different phases and the heterochromatin domain so this is a here's some nice     
35:55     
graphs if you're interested in how they kind of measure     
36:03     
this and uh yeah so this is basically the     
36:08     
conclusion phase separation provides a compelling model for the functional organization of biomolecules in the     
36:14     
nucleus and elsewhere within living cells in recent years significant progress has been made to move Beyond or     
36:22     
overly simplified in sometimes only qualitative models where it's considering the ramifications of the     
36:28     
uniquely complex environment of the cell as on phase separation uh in particular the mechanic     
36:35     
mechanochemical complexity of the intracellular environment gives rise to unexpected behavior and indeed potential     
36:43     
even new physics so that's interesting uh these include behaviors not predicted by the simplest two-phase liquid uh so     
36:50     
there are different binary models that you can use to look at this the presence of many sta sized aspherical droplets or     
36:59     
composition dependent saturation concentration so there's this idea of uh     
37:06     
one particularly intriguing intracellular complication is the viscal elasticity of the cell so fisal     
37:13     
elasticity is probably a key driver of a lot of these processes but we don't know you know we can measure it but we don't     
37:19     
know what it means what sort of the rules are of the nucleus well both nuclear bodies nuclear     
37:26     
mechanics have been separately investigated for decades conceptual framework of nuclear bodies is Phase     
37:32     
separated condensates provide an opening for understanding their interplay with     
37:37     
nuclear mechanics so this idea of phase separated condensates and what nuclear     
37:44     
bodies how they their Dynamics within the nucleus that's something we don't you know that's that's maybe a new area     
37:50     
that that might emerge from this work the effects of the mechanics of the environment on phase separated drop     
37:56     
droplets is only recently begun to be appreciated in biology uh but we need more work and and     
38:03     
methods to measure the physical parameters such as surface tension permeation stress and     
38:10     
elasticity and this theory predicts this will govern the condensate behavior in     
38:16     
cells and so then the other complication and maybe opportunity is to understand     
38:21     
non-equilibrium activity in an intracellular context so what is the sort of the equilibrium     
38:28     
activity within the cell for different cell types and you know we need to we don't really know how to deal with     
38:35     
that linking mechanics and phase separation when we approach this uh from     
38:41     
with our current approaches it assumes thermodynamic equilibrium but of course we can't assume that in the biological     
38:48     
system um there's a lot of biological regulation going on so it's in in a high     
38:53     
state of non-e equilibrium and so we we can ask some questions about this but you know to get the answers we need to     
39:00     
have sort of non-equilibrium friendly methods so     
39:05     
um so some of these questions are do cells use condensates as sensor as a     
39:11     
mechanical stimula so for example to alter the epigenetic state and stiffness of the nucleus in response to external     
39:18     
forces so you know there there's uh stuff going on between the nucleus and the rest of the cell and are those     
39:25     
regulated by external forces are you know like there's stimuli that uh     
39:31     
activate uh first uh you know first uh first messenger uh genes and things     
39:39     
like that you know are those things regulated by some sort of physical mechanism uh can condensat also directly     
39:46     
alter local nuclear Vis viscal elasticity to respond to changing mechanical     
39:51     
requirements so is viscal elasticity the regulating Factor are we getting this     
39:57     
viscal elastic regulation in response to some of the things that going on in the cell's mechanical     
40:03     
environment and so condensates may play a role for this uh in different ways at     
40:09     
multi multiple time and length scales this could range from maintaining heterochromatin mediated bulk Nu clear     
40:16     
mechanics to coordinating protection and repair and response to DNA damage so if this is the case then we     
40:24     
have a lot of maybe really interesting answers to these questions that go     
40:29     
beyond this immediate model of the nucleus um yeah so this is a nice review     
40:37     
paper I wanted to go over that because I we haven't really given the nucleus at do I guess um so let's take a look in at     
40:44     
the chat and see what we have here so yeah this is where we were uh     
40:51     
yeah we we talked about this uh work by R Nel should showed that     
40:56     
Chromo chromosomes of circular ordering and this is in in ukar so this     
41:04     
isn't like a circular chromosome this is actually just the circular ordering of     
41:10     
the chromosomes and you know uh so Susan's has oh I guess these     
41:18     
are the references that she put in um the first is non-channel mechanos     
41:23     
sensors working at focal adhesion stress fiber complex so this is uh one article and     
41:29     
then the other article is mechanics and functional consequences of nuclear     
41:35     
deformations yeah and then dick says or an intellectual trap so     
41:42     
that's yeah it probably could be I mean you know it's not an easy area to     
41:48     
study and then Susan says the mechanics of cells is affected by pH I can share my screen to show the VCU     
41:56     
un act in connection yeah would you like to share your screen     
42:17     
okay all right there we go there we go yeah so that's the     
42:25     
intermediate filament vulin associated with the active so it looks like there's a     
42:30     
flow and yeah and the vulon is being added in     
42:38     
after the force after the retrograde flow the Acom myosin force is going in One Direction and then the vulon is     
42:45     
being added in and yeah this is non-channel mechanos     
42:52     
sensors working at focal adhesion stress fiber complex this is from this paper     
42:57     
right okay it's great thank     
43:09     
you right oh I hear     
43:15     
something is that just the     
43:22     
microphone okay yeah I don't know I don't know why everything is is uh strain softening or strain hard     
43:30     
hardening what does that mean     
43:50     
oh the V you on Incorporated with the ACT yeah so it depends on the softening or     
43:57     
hardening or people don't know what it is or so yeah they don't know yeah so it's     
44:04     
somehow being Incorporated in the act and then they don't necessarily know why it's happening but it's     
44:16     
there the definition of straight earning was steel so that was the example of Steel that was strain     
44:25     
hard     
44:30     
yeah well that's a nice find yeah thank you for it's like dick is uh typing     
44:38     
something in the circular ording ordering is     
44:45     
consistent with uh man mantis's observations of DNA     
44:50     
chal linkers okay     
45:16     
yeah might be worth reviewing yeah yeah if you could send me the reference for that I could do a review on it or look     
45:23     
at look at it in the meeting because it might be a nice uh you know because I mean there's     
45:29     
probably a lot of literature on the nucleus that uh and then just reviewed a little     
45:34     
bit here in this uh paper or in these two papers     
45:53     
but yeah so I don't know why our audio is way it is today but hopefully we do this     
45:59     
again you know uh it won't be like this but I don't know it's like playing we're     
46:04     
playing like audio tag or something I don't know so yeah thanks for that uh so     
46:11     
that's good I think we'll end for today um so you wanted to mention anything     
46:22     
else might have something he's typing in     
46:34     
Nel's papers okay there we go there's Nelle alasco Anderson at all uh tiir     
46:43     
associations in interphase nuclei possible role of Maintenance of interphase chromosome topology and now     
46:50     
is from 2001 okay     
46:59     
yeah it's interesting I have to review that maybe next week follow up on a     
47:08     
couple things I'd like to follow up on actually     
47:15     
but all right um well thanks for that so all right well thanks for bearing with     
47:21     
me on the audio and uh all     
47:26     
right have a good week you all right so now I'd like to cover a     
47:33     
few papers uh two of which Susan brought up in the meeting in an area we're     
47:38     
calling morphogenetic physics so the first paper Susan talked about     
47:43     
was this paper on computation of the effective mechanical response of     
47:49     
biological networks accounting for large configuration changes so this is the one     
47:54     
that was intriguing from the standpoint of configurational change and these uh     
48:02     
responding biological networks so let's read the     
48:08     
abstract the ASM totic homogenization technique is involved to derive the     
48:14     
effective elastic response biological membranes viewed as repetitive beam networks and we'll see what this look     
48:20     
like later thereby a systematic methodology is established allowing the production     
48:26     
of the overall mechanical properties of biological membranes in the nonlinear     
48:32     
regime so this is an important concept that we have biological membranes we're modeling them with mechanical models and     
48:40     
we're modeling it so that we can capture this nonlinear regime this is if you force the membrane     
48:46     
it has a response that is not linear uh reflecting the influence of the     
48:52     
geometrical and mechanical microparameters of the Network structure     
48:57     
on the overall response of the equivalent Continuum so this is just talking about     
49:02     
the the uh sort of the network structure itself and and the uh responses     
49:08     
biomembranes networks are classified based on nodal connectivity so that we analyze in the word three four and six     
49:15     
connectivity networks and this is referring to like fold connectivity or     
49:20     
fold and want to say symmetry but it's similar to that which are representative of most     
49:27     
biological networks the individual filaments of the network are described as ulated beams     
49:34     
per entropic elasticity the tensile moduli determined from their persistence length the effect     
49:41     
of micropolar Continuum evaluated as a Continuum substrate of the biological     
49:46     
Network as a kinematics which means a hezza sort of motion Dynamics reflecting     
49:52     
the discrete Network deformation modes involving a noal displacement and a     
49:57     
micro rotation the peptidoglycan network May exhibit a re-entrant hexagonal     
50:03     
configuration due to Thermal or pressure fluctuations so this this is translating     
50:09     
back to the biology our mechanical Network that we're simulating is actually a peptido gly network and     
50:16     
that's the sort of the surface of the cell we're taking the properties of these um macro molecules and we're sort     
50:24     
of fitting it into this model so they say it may this sort of     
50:30     
network May exhibit a reentrant hexagonal configuration due to Thermal or pressure     
50:36     
fluctuations which micropolar effects become important the homogenized     
50:41     
responses are in good agreement with finite element simulations were formed     
50:47     
over the whole network the predictive nature of the employed homogeneization technique well as the identification of     
50:53     
a strain energy density of a hyperelastic model for the purpose of Performing structural     
51:00     
calculations of the shape evolutions of biomembranes so this is their model here     
51:06     
we have what they call 34 and sixfold connectivity so they're taking a look at these macromolecule networks we have     
51:13     
sugar rings linked by peptides and this gives us a three-fold connectivity so     
51:19     
this threefold connectivity has Junctions where you have three elements coming together at one point so this is     
51:26     
an example here let me draw this out on a board so a three-fold connectivity is something like     
51:32     
this so we have one two and three so there are three     
51:38     
spaces in between this Junction so this this Junction is formed by some vertex     
51:44     
in the net so that vertex is this threefold     
51:51     
complexity okay so you have and there of course mechanical advantages to this and     
51:57     
there structural advantages to this as well so let's go back to the example here of four-fold connectivity actually     
52:05     
here's some thing from the nucleus and so we have a nuclear     
52:10     
membrane we have pores in the nuclear membrane we have the nuclear lamina inside the nuclear membrane and then the     
52:17     
area inside the loom in continuing DNA and so this is what we call four-fold     
52:23     
connectivity which is this nuclear lamina so you can see the lamina which     
52:29     
is this Square pattern and so it gives us fourfold connectivity and you can see     
52:34     
that there are four elements coming together in one spot so this gives us     
52:40     
something like this we have a Vertex     
52:47     
here and again we have one 2 three and     
52:53     
four and so this again has has different mechanical and structural     
52:58     
advantages this is four-fold connectivity and so then we let's go     
53:04     
back to the sixfold connectivity example where we have uh this is from a     
53:11     
red blood cell so this is what Susan mentioned in the meeting you have these irregular shaped edges so these are RR     
53:18     
site Network and so again our six connectivity this is the vertex     
53:28     
and we have six elements like so so again structural and     
53:37     
functional advantages to that so you see all these different types of conductivity and different     
53:43     
types of tissues and and structures uh in structural biology and then the     
53:49     
question is why do we have these different types of conductivity um is it that it's     
53:55     
optimizing for the different conditions that are required for that thing so for     
54:00     
example red blood cells Rite networks are optimized for cells through the     
54:06     
bloodstream the nuclear lamina is optimized for a structure that has some give some rigidity to the nucleus or     
54:14     
this set of sugar rings and peptides we know that hexagons give really optimal     
54:21     
uh packing structure so maybe there's something about that or maybe some sort of structural stability so we don't     
54:28     
really know why that you know they are the way they are it's just that we have we can identify these different types of     
54:33     
connectivity in these networks so this is again an example of     
54:39     
peptides and sugar rings this peptidoglycan network and we can model this in terms of nodes and     
54:49     
edges so let's read a little bit about three-fold connectivity so we have it is     
54:56     
believed that this molecular and isotropic organization is dictated by Design principles of the cell such that     
55:04     
the stiffer chains act as reinforcement in the direction that sustain the maximum stress the knowledge of the     
55:09     
mechanis mechanical properties of eply is of importance for understanding bacterial growth and form and the angle     
55:17     
is used as a descriptor of the topology of the gon Network so we're looking at the angle uh radiating from those     
55:25     
not nodes the vertex is sort of the organizing point in in different parts     
55:30     
of the network this varies in between 5 degrees and 20 Dees according to the dimensions of the molecular chains of     
55:37     
the unit cell shown in figure two we evaluate the average young modula     
55:42     
of gin at low temperature the Young's modulus are elaborated from the persistence length according to this     
55:48     
relation now let's look at fourfold connectivity so the nuclear lamina can     
55:54     
change Junctions that have four-fold coordination the nucleus is bounded by two membranes and the lamina lies in the     
56:01     
interior of the nucleus adjacent to the inner nuclear membranes so this is a biological Square     
56:08     
Network the animal cytoskeletons consists of three interconnected filament systems the acting containing     
56:15     
microfilaments microtubules and the Lesser known intermediate     
56:20     
filaments intermediate filaments are known to impart mechanical stability single intermediate filbin can     
56:28     
be described as a flexible extensible and tough material uh which has important implications for our     
56:34     
understanding of cell and tissue mechanics so the nuclear Lam is composed of these it's a mesh work at the nuclear     
56:41     
membrane that protects the genetic material and regulates gene expression uh the geometry of the mesh     
56:48     
work is obtained from experimental observations of the nuclear lamina and they use zenopus as a model organism     
56:55     
uh the network is composed of two sets of NE orthogonal intermediate filaments     
57:00     
with a lce constant of uh 50 nanom and a diameter of 10 nanom let's talk about     
57:06     
sixfold connectivity so the membrane of the arther site has both a low density and     
57:13     
high flexibility furthermore the corresponding lattice is sixfold conductivity with however 3% and 8% of     
57:20     
the Junctions presenting five and or seven folds respectively so this isn't uniform across the Orr     
57:28     
site Network you can have sixfold connectivity but you can also have five and Sevenfold connectivity at low     
57:35     
frequencies so this is interesting because you know this isn't a uniform Network this is a an an isotropic     
57:41     
network with respect to these sort of Junctions and so why would we have this difference in Junctions given that we     
57:48     
don't necessarily see this in the other networks so then they just kind of assume a rectangular beam section and     
57:53     
they simulate that they don't really give an answer as to why that is okay so some of the things we can do with this kind of a network and in this case we're     
58:01     
looking at a four connectivity Network so we're looking at something that you might see in the nuclear lamina this is     
58:07     
the topology of the four connectivity Network here and then the nonlinear bending     
58:13     
response so you can look at this network and the and the vertices that form the     
58:18     
Junctions and then you can take that area the area between the vertices     
58:23     
especially and get a nonlinear bending response for that local part of the network and so this is where we have a     
58:30     
linear and a nonlinear response so this is the Y modulus and then this is     
58:36     
the I guess the length measurement so we can see is this thing is deformed we     
58:41     
have different properties okay the second paper Susan talked about in the meeting is this one here cell mechanics     
58:49     
dissecting the physical responses of cells to force so this is a review article this from     
58:55     
2009 by Brenton Hoffman and John Crocker let's read the abstract uh it is now widely appreciated     
59:02     
that normal tissue morphology and function rely upon cell's ability to sense and generate forces appropriate to     
59:09     
their correct tissue context although the effects of forces on cells have been studied for decades our understanding of     
59:16     
how these forces propagate through and act on different cell substructures remain at an early stage so they're uh     
59:24     
leading up from the last paper you can identify these different types of networks and you know we can see that     
59:31     
they behave differently and so the consequence of that is that if you apply a force to a biological tissue if it's     
59:38     
made up of these different type of network topologies you end up with different types of effects the past     
59:43     
decade has seen a Resurgence of Interest with a wide variety of different micromechanical methods in current use     
59:50     
that probe cells dynamic deoration in response to a Time varying Force     
59:55     
so you know we have this variability based on the physics but we can also have a Time varying force from the     
1:00:02     
outside the ability of researchers to carefully measure the mechanical properties of cells subjugated to a wide     
1:00:08     
variety of pharmacological and genetic interventions however currently our strips are ability to quantitatively     
1:00:14     
interpret the data in many cases now despite these challenges the     
1:00:20     
stage is now set for the development of detailed models for cell deformability motility and meano sensing and we can     
1:00:27     
look at that at the molecular level and so this is a very long review article they talk about seeking a consensus     
1:00:34     
description so a lot of the papers we're doing in the meetings are sort of recent papers they're from the last several     
1:00:40     
years but this review is from 2009 so they're talking about how you might engage in this activity and so they're     
1:00:48     
providing this uh ways you know kind of ways of getting to a consensus     
1:00:53     
description so you know we can measure things over a wide frequency     
1:01:00     
range we can account for variables by probing connectivity and cell heterogenity which we saw in the last     
1:01:06     
paper we have the effect effects of non-thermal random forces we have evidence for mechanically     
1:01:13     
distinct structures so we just saw that in the last paper as well and we need a consensus description     
1:01:19     
for unperturbed cells or an equilibrium State and so this is these are all things that people have worked on people     
1:01:26     
are working on the details of this the second part is lack of consensus acting and myosin PR turbations and their     
1:01:33     
interpretations so they talk about actin perturbations where you perturb actin     
1:01:39     
molecules you have Vaso actin compounds in meos and specific     
1:01:45     
interations you have Universal versus non-universal exponent approaches and a modified consensus     
1:01:52     
description adding a distinct actom I Network and then the mathematical properties of power laws can confound     
1:02:00     
interpretation so these two are kind of interesting because these are three 3.3     
1:02:05     
and 3.5 because this is sort of the meat and potatoes     
1:02:10     
of complexity Theory and sort of this concept of universality in other words we expect     
1:02:17     
things to behave in the same way across systems and we can use you know single     
1:02:23     
single tools to get at different questions and the question is is this     
1:02:28     
something that we should be doing in this kind of environment so you know there have been     
1:02:34     
papers that have criticized the application of power laws uh in physics and in complexity     
1:02:41     
Theory but there have been a lot of papers that have supported power law interpretations so power laws are you     
1:02:47     
know somewhat controversial maybe uh you know are they applicable across domains     
1:02:52     
what do we make of a Power log exponent these sorts of things and then you know we have these Universal versus     
1:02:59     
non-universal exponent options so we usually calculate some sort of exponent     
1:03:04     
on our data in the last example we had a linear versus a nonlinear function and you would take     
1:03:11     
the exponents from those at least the nonlinear function and you would compare with different types of systems and the     
1:03:18     
question is is that something that you can do is that something that's reliable does that bring us towards     
1:03:24     
consensus between cell types and then having a model of the cell mechanical response so they're different models     
1:03:30     
that people have uh advocated for so there's this they have an overview of     
1:03:36     
the model space which includes all the models that you know the main models and some like the more obscure     
1:03:43     
models uh some of the main models include the soul gel hypothesis a 10 segr model the soft     
1:03:50     
glassy rology model active gels and dynamic cross links and other emerging     
1:03:56     
models this is something to follow up on we of course are supporters of the 10 segr model in this group uh there other     
1:04:03     
models you know active gels soft glyat rology model which you've kind of     
1:04:09     
touched on as well this is something again we need to sort of get a sense of what kind of model is best or what kinds     
1:04:15     
of models are best or describing these sorts of things and     
1:04:21     
then the implications for cell biology we can talk about mechano transduction which is a lot of what we were sort of     
1:04:29     
our immediate interest here Susan's project but then other biological processes as well so I'd like to     
1:04:35     
conclude with going over the abstract pretty diverse but I think they give an idea of like how to apply some of these     
1:04:41     
ideas to larger scale systems so the first paper is from     
1:04:46     
Hernandez Lopez at all and this is uh two fluid dynamics in     
1:04:52     
Micron and Boundary layer shape cytoplasmic flows and early D soft LS so this is a fluid dynamics boundary     
1:05:01     
layers in embryogenesis I'll read the significance     
1:05:07     
section and then we'll read the abstract so the significant section reads embryos and cells often feature     
1:05:14     
substantial flows of their cytoplasmic components so this is where we have flows and we've seen this in uh within     
1:05:21     
the cell but also within EMB while the Reynolds numbers are moderate flows typically involve     
1:05:27     
non-trivial couplings between mechanics and biochemistry so in other words you know the renold's number is really small     
1:05:33     
or really large we you know use that as sort that the sort of outliers as an     
1:05:38     
example of a system that's interesting uh if a Reynolds number is moderate we don't really worry about you know     
1:05:44     
laminer Behavior or turbulent Behavior it's just kind of a normal sort of     
1:05:50     
situation uh but these flows actually involve non trivial couplings between mechanics and biochemistry meaning that     
1:05:57     
the mechanics are interesting even if the Reynolds numbers are you know within a normal     
1:06:03     
range here recouple the mechanics of cytoplasmic flows to the cell cycles of embryonic nuclei under     
1:06:09     
sophs so this is where we have these embryonic nuclei before cellularization and inoph     
1:06:18     
embryo and we have these mechanics of these flows of the cytoplasm we show the fundament and     
1:06:24     
empirical reasons to impose a multiphase model with both a passive cytool and an     
1:06:30     
active fluid the acor myos so we have two uh components of this     
1:06:38     
model this is a multiphase model so it has multiple components we have a     
1:06:44     
passive component which is the cytool and an active fluid which is the active iioa Network so we have two parts     
1:06:52     
entrainment of the passive by the active fluid so that means that active fluid uh     
1:06:58     
sort of entrains the frequency domain of the passive element of the model     
1:07:05     
dramatically concentrates in a thin boundary layer at the embryo cortex the model recapitulates experimental flow     
1:07:12     
patterns explains previously elusive observations it makes a series of     
1:07:18     
predictions which is you know what a good model in theory should do in particular the icted relations between     
1:07:25     
the flow structure and embryo geometry are experimentally confirmed so what they've been able to     
1:07:31     
do is take a multiphase model with two components show held those things     
1:07:36     
synchronize and behave together and then use it to explain different aspects of     
1:07:41     
the system so the abstract reads cytoplasmic     
1:07:47     
flows are widely emerging as a key functional player in development in early dropa embryos Flo     
1:07:54     
Drive the spreading of the nuclei across the embryo so this is where the nuclei spread out across the embryo you have     
1:08:00     
this flow they have to be in trained so that they're you know in sort of a     
1:08:06     
decent position for later development here we combine hydrodynamic     
1:08:11     
modeling with quantitative Imaging so they're doing the modeling they're also doing Imaging to develop a two fluid     
1:08:17     
model and this so this is this multiphase model that features an active     
1:08:23     
meios gel and a passive viscous cytool gel contractility is controlled     
1:08:28     
by the cell cycle oscillator the two fluids being coupled by friction so this     
1:08:34     
is where we have this uh you know the gel contractility is controlled by some     
1:08:39     
sort of model of an oscillator and the fluids being coupled by friction which     
1:08:45     
is a force uh in addition to recapitulating experimental flow patterns our models     
1:08:51     
explain observations that remain elusive to make make a series of predictions first the model captures the voltic of     
1:08:58     
cytosolic flows which highlights deviations from Stokes flows that were observed experimentally but remain     
1:09:05     
unexplained second the model reveals strong differences in the gel and cytool motion in particular a micron siiz     
1:09:12     
boundary layer is predicted close to the cortex where the gel slides tangentially     
1:09:18     
while the cytosolic flow cannot slip there the model reveals a mechanism that stabilizes spreading nuclei with respect     
1:09:25     
to perturbations of their initial positions the self-correcting mechanism is argued to be functionally important     
1:09:32     
with proper nuclear spreading fourth we use our model to analyze the effects of flows on the     
1:09:37     
transport of the morphogen bid and the establishment of its gradients finally     
1:09:43     
the model predicts that the flow string should be reduced if the shape of the domain is more round which is     
1:09:48     
experimentally confirmed by mutant mutant phenotypes thus our two fluid model     
1:09:55     
explains flows of nuclear positioning in early drop while making predictions that suggest novel future experiments so this     
1:10:02     
figure one shows a scheme for the mechanochemical coupling underlying or model for cytoplasmic FS so this is a     
1:10:09     
sketch depicting a slice of the anterior side of the egg so this is sort of the front part of the egg along with the     
1:10:17     
ingredients of our model and their location in space so you have the nuclei here and then you have the flows the     
1:10:24     
soul flows the gel flows which go up to the surface and then this green which is     
1:10:31     
the BIOS and then this on the right here we see captions and interaction sequences     
1:10:38     
detailing the mechanochemical coupling that result in nuclei being transported in the embryo iosin 2 drives gel flows     
1:10:46     
there's friction that interacts with soul flows it's advection which interacts with the nucleus or any n one     
1:10:54     
nucleus uh this activates pp1 which is a factor that promotes meios and 2 so you     
1:11:00     
can see this is a positive feedback loop containing multiple components and so this is an example of the uh embryonic     
1:11:07     
flows you have the tooph embryo you have these flows that occur our second paper     
1:11:14     
is forceful patterning theoretical principles of mechanochemical pattern formation so this is Jen rotz Jenna     
1:11:22     
Elliot Anna RBG biological pattern formation is essential for generating     
1:11:29     
and maintaining spatial structures from the scale of a single cell to tissues and even collections of     
1:11:35     
organisms besides biomechanical interactions there is an important role for mechanical and geometric features in     
1:11:42     
the generation of patterns we review the theoretical principles underlying different types of mechanochemical     
1:11:48     
pattern formation across spatial skills and levels of biological organization so     
1:11:54     
they kind of go through uh more of a theoretical approach to this the last paper was very much empirical paper this     
1:12:01     
is a theoretical paper so in the following we introduced some of the theoretical Concepts used to study     
1:12:07     
pattern formation we consider patterns as regular spatial features that consist     
1:12:12     
of many units by units they mean cells or molecules where the characteristic     
1:12:17     
length scale of the pattern is much larger than the size of a single unit a     
1:12:22     
pattern can be structural characterized by a regular shape or can be manifest as regular variations in the concentration     
1:12:30     
or density typically a pattern consists of repeated features in that case we     
1:12:35     
identify a pattern's length scale with its wavelength that is the distance between repeated features we refer to     
1:12:43     
the length scale of individual units L is microscopic and the pattern length     
1:12:48     
scale is mesoscopic relative to the macroscopic size L of the whole system     
1:12:54     
system and so then this is basically a local Global sort of mapping where you     
1:13:00     
understand pattern formation and the patterns are repeated and using the patterns is sort of a unit of     
1:13:06     
analysis U that is larger than the single unit so you can look at emergent phenomenon you can look at local versus     
1:13:14     
global effects and things like that so in some cases this allows for a statistical description so when the

spatial scales are well separated the large number of macroscopic units that make up a wavelength of the pattern     
1:13:27     
permits a statistical description an example such as description as a concentration field that keeps track of     
1:13:34     
only the average number of units per length area or volume in each point in Space in Time SP separation of spatial     
1:13:42     
scales in many cases also implies a separation of temporal scales because things may happen like from one end to     
1:13:49     
the embryo to the other or something like that so indeed the mean Collision time of water molecules within a typical     
1:13:55     
ocean wave with a period of 10 seconds is below 10 theus1     
1:14:01     
seconds uh within the acting cortex of the cell surface typical time scales of macromolecular interaction are on the     
1:14:08     
order of milliseconds whereas they lead to cell level shape Dynamics and flows     
1:14:13     
on the minute to hour scale so this is interesting that you have these different time scales that they uh put     
1:14:19     
into their etical uh considerations as well
