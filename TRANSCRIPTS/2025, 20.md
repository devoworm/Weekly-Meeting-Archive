## TRANSCRIPT     
0:00     
hello hi hi how are you i'm pretty good     
0:07     
i'm not doing enough research but     
0:15     
and I went to my convocation oh okay that's great yeah so I have a a     
0:22     
hat with a tassel on it that says 2025 i got a free lunch     
0:29     
so you're also in the education college or or something like that i have um post     
0:35     
balorate in education oh okay and I taught high school at the adult learning     
0:42     
center in near here for 11 years oh okay that's good so most of the time that I     
0:49     
was attending it was um attending here it was uh during class if there was no     
0:56     
if there were were no students I would attend online okay     
1:06     
yeah i um yeah a lot of it was was in the learning     
1:13     
center um well some people would turn up at nine o'clock but not very many like the     
1:20     
10 is a wander in an 11 yeah so it was it's a one was a one room     
1:28     
uh classroom situation and I taught uh 12     
1:34     
subjects but it was on an individual basis and usually I didn't run a     
1:39     
classroom except in the evening for people in math     
1:45     
i did teach physics like that once and that worked better than them studying     
1:50     
physics on their own i have to say that much and I did run some biology classes too     
1:57     
but mostly it was math     
2:02     
that's what they needed they needed just a really good grounding in math     
2:09     
well that's great yeah that helped you understand more math so you could do     
2:15     
your teaching it did um in a way because I call it baby math but also the     
2:23     
distance ed people had me teaching calculus and that help helped me with     
2:29     
some of my foundations in calculus that I seem to have forgotten     
2:35     
so yeah it helped me with calculus yeah     
2:41     
yeah because uh the math um I taught all levels     
2:51     
so anyways yeah so I'm I don't know yeah 12 subjects is a lot overall I     
3:00     
think I taught um 21 subjects um I taught anatomy and     
3:07     
physiology too at the college level okay so that really helped me um when I hit     
3:14     
biomed engineering they said "Well you have to take anatomy and physiology and     
3:19     
we want you to do it with all these other things." And that was a a lot of     
3:24     
courses for you to take all at once and try to get an A plus standing in so I said "I taught     
3:32     
it so I I I know it." And they believed me so well I I proved it i sent them the     
3:41     
course outline and stuff so and that also helped me when I     
3:47     
was presenting my thesis right because they said uh oh and and uh you said here     
3:55     
that [Music] um neuro proteins change uh confirmation     
4:02     
and also physical properties in um with changing temperature and with     
4:10     
changing uh pH and so on so uh how can you ensure that your model is going to     
4:18     
work all the time and I said in [Music] um a mamalian cell that's very tightly     
4:28     
controlled period so it was a good answer yeah yeah     
4:36     
yeah absolutely anyways yeah my background in anatomy     
4:42     
and physiology has certainly helped because this is a biology it was a     
4:48     
biology and mechanical engineering thesis right     
4:54     
yeah it's always tough to switch between them yeah i didn't have Anyway yes oh     
5:00     
it's always tough to switch between them like you know a lot of times your committee members will converse in one     
5:06     
but not the other others will be conversant in one but not the other the one one fellow was from dentistry so     
5:13     
he kind of knew the mechanics right and he he definitely knew the biology and     
5:20     
then the other fellow is from biosystems engineering and he knew the mechanics     
5:25     
and some of the biology but he he admitted that I knew more biology than     
5:30     
he did so     
5:37     
yeah and the third fellow just said "I'm here to listen explain it to me so a     
5:43     
normal person can understand this he's not a normal person he's very     
5:50     
intelligent but he's um um     
5:55     
electrical an electrical engineer and if there was such a thing as um as a um     
6:02     
mathematical engineer it would be him okay yeah he's very heavily into math     
6:09     
the math behind optical coins tomography so Oh yeah     
6:16     
yeah so I don't know that's that's an explanation of that I     
6:23     
guess so yeah and by the way never try to     
6:30     
teach um computer science over the phone     
6:38     
doesn't work very well just like uh what what do you mean by that what were you     
6:43     
trying to do um the distance education people had me teaching     
6:49     
um um the beginner computer science over the     
6:54     
phone and we were programming in was it in C     
7:00     
yeah that's kind of tough it was like um okay was C++ that what that's what it     
7:07     
was and I had to first off I had to find the right version of C++ buy a textbook     
7:15     
about it so that I could get the programming right on my computer that was a mess anyways and and     
7:23     
you try to explain some things over the phone to them please do like they did     
7:29     
have a a um booklet where they had exercises and they ju just were not     
7:35     
understanding that learning computer science is kind of a discovery process     
7:41     
where you do something you make a mistake and then you learn that's the error message and that's something you     
7:46     
don't do and I said you have to do the exercises in chapter two     
7:54     
or you won't get anywhere have you done the exercise you have to do no obviously     
8:01     
they hadn't and they're going "Ah this is a bunch of noise." And it was like "I     
8:06     
can't help you." Yeah you're going to fail i'm sorry     
8:11     
yeah it's It's I mean it's like that visual component as well like if I     
8:17     
explained to you over the phone how to program something like maybe you can get it but you wouldn't get it like you     
8:23     
wouldn't understand how to fix it or how it works you just don't know like every line and every command yeah and D said     
8:31     
had an online visual video     
8:36     
um video method at that time like I I could have done it over the internet but the um super     
8:46     
religious um colonies out here wouldn't have it so these boys wanted really     
8:53     
wanted to learn computer science but they somehow they didn't want to do     
9:01     
chapter 2 huh thoroughly what was chapter two     
9:07     
it was program this line hello world um type in hello world get it up     
9:15     
and running and type this in and then um enter and it should type hello world     
9:24     
for you and also um if you change the     
9:29     
semicolon for a colon for a comma what happens and like just you know sort of     
9:37     
general syntax rules going through them and it's like for some reason they     
9:43     
weren't doing it i don't know what was wrong they were at the other end of a     
9:50     
phone i don't maybe they went to class and then then went outside and played     
9:55     
ball i have no idea yeah it's hard to Yeah like I'll wait on the phone here for 15 minutes while you do Yeah well     
10:03     
while the teacher tries to tell you to do chapter two yeah yeah anyway don't     
10:11     
the phones and computer science it's it's too visual for that     
10:16     
unless [Music] you're Well if you're if you're blind you can definitely learn computer     
10:22     
programming but you have to pay more attention to well the syntax of syntax of whatever     
10:31     
you're doing whatever language     
10:36     
anyways it didn't work     
10:45     
they got it or they didn't get it and it was how to write poems that I was     
10:52     
teaching into and there was one genius and she was she was um I guess a grade     
11:00     
12 student and she was like she said yeah she understood what I was talking     
11:06     
about but the other students even though she got it the other students weren't     
11:12     
getting it so I still don't know where the disconnect was because she she she     
11:17     
was right there with them and she understood it and she couldn't explain it to them     
11:23     
yes i don't     
11:30     
know yep so that that's for anybody do not     
11:36     
try to teach computer science over the phone looks like Leila is here hello so I did     
11:42     
want to go over some uh thing like we talked about I think two weeks     
11:48     
ago asked about some conneto data sets and we have some conneto data sets in     
11:54     
the group we've actually published two papers in the group on connetos i'm going to go over that now     
12:02     
the first uh data set is in this uh repository evoorm embryoggenetic     
12:10     
connector and so this has um a bunch of data files um I think it's graph ML     
12:17     
files and CSV files so these are connecttos at different stages of     
12:24     
development or at least the developmental cells at each stage of development so um you know we have the     
12:31     
developmental cells at their nomenclature and then we have they terminally differentiate into neurons     
12:38     
that have a different nomenclature um and so then this uh these files um talk     
12:45     
about first of all uh the cells that are involved in the     
12:51     
conneto at different stages of development and then those cells as they differentiate membranes and so uh     
13:00     
there's like an interact which is like the cells um     
13:13     
preconnealing each other through paracrine and jostrine relationships     
13:19     
meaning that they're exchanging chemical signals and and things like that and then eventually you get this     
13:26     
connectivity through gap junctions but I think you have gap junctions in the developmental cells as well but you get     
13:33     
this connectivity through gap junctions that is verified in the conneto so then     
13:38     
that becomes sort of those cells when they're born when they termally     
13:44     
differentiate they get put into place in that conneto so this des all these files     
13:51     
describe the sort of the emergent conneto at different stages of     
13:56     
development and so um that is associated with the paper that uh was published in     
14:03     
2018 this was in bios systems uh this was the emerging conneto in C elegance     
14:11     
embryogenesis and it goes through uh a lot of the analysis of these data i     
14:18     
don't think it really shows the entire paper here have to go through and open     
14:23     
up the PDF but basically this paper uh discusses this data set shows some     
14:31     
analyses but there is source data here um actually maybe we have some     
14:40     
images okay so this is actually interesting uh one of the things they did in this paper was to take all of the     
14:47     
cells in the conneto and plot them out on a model of And this is uh from the uh     
14:53     
open worm browser so the open worm browser is an model of the adult worm     
14:59     
and you can open it up in 3D and you can label cells based on their identity so     
15:06     
each cell in the adult worm you can highlight it in the model and you can     
15:12     
get a description of what that cell does and its properties but you can also kind     
15:17     
of highlight groups of cells and so this is showing the conneto and so this is     
15:24     
these are all the neur neurons in the conneto you notice there are a lot of neurons up at the head the fernx down     
15:31     
the side of the body like you know seam cell associated neurons and then we have     
15:38     
a cluster of neurons in the tail the idea is that some of these have uh     
15:43     
gap junction connections some of these have um axonal and synaptic connections     
15:50     
and then this forms the adult uh connector now what we've done then is     
15:56     
just to simply say okay at each time point we get a certain fraction of those cells born so if we survey the embryo at     
16:04     
like 400 minutes of development in the embryo uh how many of those     
16:10     
cells from the adult are born at that point and so it's maybe you know a     
16:16     
fraction of those cells and so you can plot those out in the adult model to     
16:22     
show kind of where the first cells are born where what location in the adult     
16:27     
those are going to be and where later cells are and it turns out that uh you     
16:32     
get of course uh neurons in the head in this area here first and also in the     
16:39     
tail pretty early not the very first neurons that are born but um you know     
16:45     
you get them a little bit later on so you get the head and the tail where you have neurons and then of course you get     
16:51     
these these uh neurons along seam cells along the lateral side uh later and that     
16:58     
seems to hold true for the worm as it develops postembriionically is that you get cells born along the seam uh     
17:07     
epithelial cells and so this is um you know very useful I think for     
17:13     
understanding this process uh this is a let's see this is a figure this is a table where we show     
17:22     
kind of like uh at 400 minutes uh there's a mapping adult cell     
17:28     
nomenclature and the lineage uh nomenclature so you have say for example     
17:34     
ADFL which is a neuron um and that comes from this lineage AB a and then there     
17:43     
there are these L and P letters in the suffix which describe like division     
17:49     
events they describe things uh where it's I think left and posterior and     
17:56     
anterior so that you know they they divide in different directions and that's what the lineage means so we have     
18:03     
we can link this identity to a lineage tree and we can link this adult identity     
18:09     
to the open one browser so we can do that kind of mapping between two     
18:15     
different data sets two different nomenclatures and get a sense of how this works and then of course we have an     
18:22     
annotation for each cell so ADL is an ampid neuron adll is an ampid neuron     
18:30     
adfl is an amp finger cell a IML is a ring inter neuron and so forth so I     
18:37     
could look at a map in the embryo of these newly born neurons and ask why are     
18:44     
they born so early and maybe find some functional significance and because the paper is     
18:51     
now like seven years old I don't remember a lot of the findings in that     
18:58     
sense but um go read through the paper and I I believe we make some     
19:03     
interpretation there as to some of these annotations so that's this data set this     
19:10     
is all in the embryo genetic conneto repository of DVO and so this just has     
19:17     
you know a lot of graphs a lot of data sets and tables that are sort of in in a     
19:24     
form that uh basically the idea behind this repository was of course to have um you     
19:32     
know data available but also for kind of a place for people to come after they     
19:38     
read the paper and get access to these things and get access to some supplemental     
19:46     
materials yeah it's a very very good paper um and then the second one here was     
19:54     
published two years later this is another paper but we have another data set so this is divorm raising the worm     
20:01     
rate so you know the reason there's two separate repositories is because they're     
20:06     
belong to two separate papers or two separate entities but they're basically it's it's a followup to that paper and     
20:14     
this this uh paper focuses on sort of a model for     
20:20     
uh how those cells that are born during during embryogenesis and during the     
20:26     
postmbbriionic phase how those get connected together and start to form a     
20:31     
coherent conneto because what happens in the biology is that you have neurons     
20:38     
that are born in the in the embryo and then the embryo will exhibit movements     
20:44     
but those movements aren't connected to the conneto they're connected to autonomous things like muscle     
20:51     
twitching and other you know and other cell migration things so uh that's kind     
20:58     
of what happens in the embryo so there's no movement behavior driven by the     
21:03     
conneto the embryo but what tends what happens right around hatch is that those     
21:09     
connections those uh synaptic connections become salient and you start     
21:15     
to get uh goal directed movements and more intentional movements that are     
21:22     
driven by different circuits that we know in the adult we've characterized the     
21:28     
um can I add a comment yeah in embryogenesis there's There's     
21:35     
some cells that are loose and not really connected to each other in a proper     
21:41     
tissue and then they become connected and become a tissue so they're a lot     
21:47     
stronger and more connected mechanically when they become a tissue and some some     
21:55     
quote unquote tissues aren't really a tissue yet because the cells are are separate they're they're not connected     
22:02     
to each other so it kind of goes across mechanical lines too somewhat     
22:11     
at least in embryogenesis and I think that's probably true of of um     
22:18     
homeostasis and cancer development as well     
22:23     
kind of divided biology into three three things um disease     
22:31     
studies homeostasis or normal physiology and then development so well that's an     
22:39     
interesting uh division yeah well they all seem to have similarities but have     
22:45     
different outcomes     
22:50     
so yeah that that's uh anyway that's where my brain goes oh yeah i think     
22:56     
that's that's interesting yeah certainly like you know in biology     
23:04     
like some people talk about homeostasis and some people don't like physiologists are working on     
23:10     
homeostasis and but you know if you if you think about like other field other sub fields they don't talk about it as     
23:16     
much and so yeah it's it's but it's interesting to think about     
23:22     
like you have homeostasis development disease um they plasticity would also     
23:28     
fit under development yes you know you have like in disease     
23:34     
you might have a lack of plasticity or you might have too much plasticity in the case of like     
23:40     
cancer and you know so it's it's like that you have said these subheadings     
23:46     
under each one homeostasis you know how do you have plasticity under     
23:52     
homeostasis so yeah interesting     
23:58     
that just it's the way the literature is right     
24:04     
oh what do you mean the literature like Well the literature seems to break up into um those three categories     
24:12     
okay when you're looking at biology and trying to find out about the mechanics     
24:18     
themselves and um that it seems to break up into those three     
24:29     
topics areas roughly be mechano biology     
24:41     
yeah that's great um yeah so this second paper this is uh     
24:50     
where we have a bunch of different uh data sets and im you know     
24:57     
figures so these are a lot of CSV files and some of these are kind of like     
25:05     
analyses and the chemical connections are actually um data secondary data sets     
25:12     
that have been put together this was from a data set uh which is     
25:17     
described in the paper um and you know that was a data set which was made     
25:24     
available and then we took that data set and reanalyzed it and then linked it to     
25:30     
some of the data sets we had in the first paper and produced these new     
25:35     
composite data sets that described the chemical connections or the synaptic     
25:40     
connections between neurons in development so there they're this is a a     
25:47     
little bit different way of doing this because the available data sets involved     
25:52     
information about birth times of cells and their differentiation so we you know     
25:58     
when cells terminally differentiate that's considered their birth time because you get a division you get     
26:05     
divisions of developmental cells and then when you get this terminal differentiation event you usually get a     
26:12     
final division where a developmental cell will divide into two cells that then divi that then you know     
26:19     
differentiate um so that's what I mean by birth time     
26:24     
and then you have um information about synapses but those were measured in     
26:31     
laral worms so after the worm hatches it goes through four laral stages and then     
26:37     
it reaches adulthood and in those laral stages there's a lot of plasticity in the synapses and so you know there are     
26:45     
going to be a lot of changes in the synap synaptic weights and some of them     
26:50     
are transient some of them are stable and so we have that information the     
26:56     
question is is you know is there a pattern between specific types of     
27:01     
neurons and specific times that they're born and these synaptic     
27:08     
relationships and so that's one one question that was answered here there's some other questions that are also     
27:15     
answered in some of these data sets and then there was a a a game theoretic     
27:21     
model that was applied to these data to do this analysis so this this is the     
27:26     
part of the some of these other directories have to do with     
27:31     
that so that's raising the worm brain and that is linked to this paper which     
27:37     
is raising the conneto and this was published in frontiers of cellular     
27:42     
neuroscience in 2020 so this was something that was done kind of during     
27:48     
the pandemic um you know so this is uh going over     
27:54     
this these data and the model and talking about something called     
28:00     
connetogenesis which is the origins of a conneto and so this is also available     
28:08     
online you can read there okay so that was those two and I     
28:15     
wanted to highlight that because those those data sets are available for training models as you know they were     
28:22     
analyzed but they're analyzed using certain tools you can train model     
28:28     
machine learning models or yeah I don't know if there's enough data to really train it well but you know you could do     
28:34     
like you know you could generate synthetic data based on those data you know I don't know how you want     
28:41     
to do that to try to make that useful as a training set but it's all right uh hello Morgan     
28:51     
for you sorry I'm Oh it's fine yeah all right so let's move on to Yeah i think     
28:58     
I'll talk about this paper a new bioarchchive preprint uh this is Manuel Zimmer was     
29:05     
worked with the Openworm Foundation in the past so they're doing this study uh called an     
29:11     
intrinsic neuronal manifold underlies brainwide hierarchical organization of     
29:16     
behavior in sea elements the abstract reads large scale     
29:21     
neuronal recordings in various species have revealed behavior related activity patterns so a lot of connetoics involves     
29:30     
uh looking at the connections between neurons and a lot of times you have to do that at a whole brain     
29:38     
level and then you know making statements about behavior so you know we     
29:43     
don't want to know just the you know sometimes we want to do single cell recordings but we'll often do those in     
29:49     
parallel and then they boil down to maybe some hopefully some behavior that     
29:55     
we can identify and then identify not just the cells involved but the connections involved as     
30:01     
well surprisingly these activities are distributed across brain regions so     
30:06     
again you know we don't just have one cell or one small group of cells uh make     
30:14     
you know involved in a behavior usually they're wider networks that are involved     
30:20     
and you know there are exceptions to that but most of the time these are larger we did a paper uh a long time ago     
30:28     
we reviewed a paper where um you know typically in C elegance we've defined uh     
30:35     
different behavioral uh circuits but one of those is the motor circuit where you     
30:41     
have about seven or eight neurons that are involved in basic directional motion     
30:48     
so forwards and backwards towards say like a an environmental source like food     
30:55     
and this paper basically reinterpreted that as being sort of this sack of     
31:02     
neuron neuronal circuit being the core of the behavior and then other parts of     
31:07     
the conneto serving to modulate that behavior so you'd have like this core circuit and then you'd have these other     
31:14     
areas that contributed to a tuning of that behavior in different ways so this     
31:21     
is not to say that like every activity involves every part of the brain it's     
31:27     
just that there there's a lot more sort of you know regional and uh global     
31:34     
connectivity that is relevant to say certain behaviors than we usually assume     
31:41     
and so this includes sensory areas which are notorious for being kind of widely distributed and involving a lot of     
31:49     
inputs however their origins and functions are incompletely understood using whole brain imaging and freely     
31:56     
behaving segans we discover that such distributed brain activity is dominated     
32:02     
by a lowdimensional manifold so this of course is a mathematical tool uh it's     
32:08     
it's a space that you can map all this activity to it's a little dimensional so we can visualize it and this is not you     
32:15     
know a phys it's not a a physical space like we find in our models of you know     
32:22     
cell position this is um you know it's like I wouldn't want to say it's similar     
32:28     
to a latent space but it's basically the sort of mathematical space that we can map all the variation of our data     
32:37     
set corresponding to the major action sequence of C elements the manifold     
32:43     
originates largely from intrinsic dynamics with minor contributions for movement induced     
32:49     
sensations so this is where you know you have these intrinsic dynamics I I     
32:54     
suppose are the interactions between cells sort of the the things that happen     
33:00     
in these pathways how information gets processed     
33:05     
um how you know you have excitation and inhibition and things like that and then you have these     
33:13     
movement induced sensations that are that contribute minorly to this manifold     
33:18     
we discover a new function of the manifold to gate the activity of a large number of neural     
33:24     
losses so again there this uh extended     
33:30     
network or this extended circuit you might say can be mapped down to this low dimensional space and be described that     
33:37     
way we can look at the thing and visualize it see kind of what it looks like how it changes with behavior time     
33:45     
and there's this gating activity which occurs so it's sort of this regulatory     
33:51     
thing this gating constrains them to be se to selectively encode faster time     
33:56     
scale motor patterns during specific brain states so again you know you're you have this     
34:04     
behaving sea elegance a lot of times you know if you're in an experimental setting you can take away all other     
34:11     
inputs you can study movement very in a very sort of isolated setting we can     
34:18     
simulate movement with maybe seven or eight neurons we can get the basic     
34:24     
movements down but that's not really the way sea elegance behaves especially in     
34:30     
the wild where the native environment for a sea elegance     
34:36     
uh nematode is not an agar plate but it's this three-dimensional volume of     
34:42     
soil they're trying to move through the soil and they're you know consuming     
34:47     
bacteria they're moving up the column and down the column and that's so that     
34:52     
of course introduces a lot of different types of brain states a lot of sensory states a     
35:00     
lot of other types of things going on in the brain along with movement and so     
35:06     
those you know movement is contextual everything is gated through     
35:11     
this this uh larger network we therefore propose that one principal     
35:17     
function of brainwide dynamics is to enable hierarchical organization of     
35:22     
behavior information about major actions as broadcast via distributed manifold to     
35:28     
enable nesting of granular motor patterns within those major actions so there are two points here the     
35:37     
first is that well three points the first is that they propose a hierarchical organization of behavior um     
35:44     
you have the movement itself you have the things that influence movement and you have the sequences of movement that     
35:52     
can be broken down this hierarchical model so that's one thing the second thing is that they talk     
36:00     
about a manifold um almost as being like this thing you'll find in the biology     
36:05     
itself and this is something a theme you see a lot in computational neuroscience     
36:10     
where they talk about manifolds and you know you could use a manifold to sort of describe the data but you can also make     
36:18     
the assumption that there's this manifold that occurs within the brain or     
36:23     
within the connectto and so you know the question is is the conneto or the cells     
36:31     
that are being connected do they use this kind of model this representation to guide the global state or is this     
36:39     
something that is we can extract from the data and it the data fit this     
36:47     
model but is something else that biology is doing so it's an in it's an artifact     
36:53     
of information processing but does it really exist as a computation of the     
36:59     
brain and then the third thing is is that we talked about an article at our Saturday morning     
37:07     
neurosim meeting about brain emulation and C elegance and I think Morgan remembers     
37:14     
this from talking about which is u where someone wrote an article about the     
37:21     
different attempts to emulate or simulate the entire conneto of C     
37:27     
elegance and thus simulate the entire brain of C elegance the C elegance is a very small brain 302 neurons you can     
37:36     
have this sort of um you know whole brain emulation at a fairly low     
37:42     
computational cost and so the article kind of walked through the different attempts at talking about openworm as     
37:49     
being the latest attempts and almost talking about like how openorm failed     
37:55     
because there wasn't this um it didn't achieve the goals that the     
38:00     
author of the article wanted to achieve which is total brain emulation whatever that means and Morgan is familiar with     
38:08     
some of the people involved in brain emulation it's a whole field that exists     
38:14     
and the idea is is that Yeah morgan did you want to say something well I was     
38:19     
just gonna say that I'm actually going I'm driving up north Northern California     
38:24     
to a meeting of of basically all those people okay yeah so timely     
38:31     
very timely very yeah and so basically the idea is that you know you have simulation of the connective so we can     
38:38     
simulate the connective we can get behaviors out of certain neurons we     
38:43     
could even simulate this manifold activity where we say "Okay there are other cells that modulate the movement     
38:50     
and all this." And then there's emulation which is something else and     
38:55     
you know I don't know i I've read a little bit about it it's it's kind of like simulation but also putting     
39:02     
something in the in the computer uh model that is almost like sentience or     
39:09     
consciousness it's not really clear to me like that's that's my impression of it but whatever it is it's emulation is     
39:17     
like maybe a step above simulation and so like I think it's     
39:23     
interesting in light of this article because um you have this sort of model you know we have like a     
39:30     
lot of good data that's coming out all the time um regarding the conneto I     
39:37     
think connetoics in the last 10 years has made a lot of strides especially in sea elegance where you have these data     
39:44     
sets that are specific to males specific to hermaphrodites specific maybe to mutants     
39:51     
and we have a lot more data for neurons we have not just uh the uh information     
39:59     
about ion channels and other things but we're increasingly getting information     
40:04     
about real time behavior and the context of movement so we have these circuits     
40:10     
but the circuits generate the movements under different conditions that the worm finds itself in so different sensory     
40:17     
inputs different other types of states like aging and you know development and     
40:23     
whatever so it's really interesting um so that's the the summary of the     
40:29     
article um they kind of talk about some of these contoic studies so recent     
40:37     
studies have discovered neural activity correlates of instantaneous behavior     
40:42     
distributed throughout the brain and surprisingly include sensory areas or I guess surprisingly including     
40:49     
including sensory areas these observations were made across animal file invertebrates to     
40:56     
mammals including primate cortical areas outside motor cortex although to a     
41:02     
significantly lesser extent the origins and functions of these activity patterns     
41:07     
are not known reference nine     
41:12     
which reference nine comes up as this paper Kaplan and Zimmer brainwide     
41:19     
representations of ongoing behavior a universal principle so this is I guess     
41:25     
these dynamic representations and these apply to all sorts of animals of     
41:41     
brains so Manuel Zimmer is a pretty interesting person is a lot of people uh     
41:48     
neuronal population activity patterns within specific brain regions however are well described     
41:54     
so we don't necessarily know about some of these sort of uh activity patterns in contoics we     
42:02     
can't make a lot of statements about what they do and what you know why maybe     
42:08     
they are related to the movement under study or whatever the behavior under     
42:13     
study but we know about neur neuronal population activity patterns within specific brain regions so we have these     
42:21     
population studies of neurons so there's I guess a gap there um such activity     
42:28     
patterns are often modeled as smooth trajectories in a lowdimensional normal space turned to     
42:34     
manifold um so in primate motor cortical areas both the planning and execution of     
42:40     
arm reaches have been functionally linked in oral trajectories on low dimensional manifolds demonstrating that     
42:47     
manifolds can encode relevant aspects of behavior so yeah this is a classic area of this     
42:54     
sort of uh this sort of modeling recording so in primate motor areas you     
43:01     
usually have like preorder cortex motor cortex usually have a population of     
43:06     
neurons that are responsible for directional movement of arm so you have     
43:12     
usually uh they'll do an experiment where primate will be sitting in a chair and have to reach for a juice box and     
43:19     
that you know they'll put it in different locations so the reaching is in different directions and then they     
43:26     
record from a population of neurons and that population of neurons are doing     
43:32     
things that are somewhat stochastic they're firing and sometimes they become synchronized     
43:38     
uh to a certain phase angle which then translates into uh movement uh in a     
43:44     
certain direction and a lot of the when they record the data they'll do like an     
43:50     
average of the activity and they'll be able to replicate that uh movement     
43:55     
direction so they can actually get the reporting they can uh you know go     
44:01     
through the uh gross activity of the population find the average and predict     
44:08     
the direction of movement and they use that kind of signal in brain computer     
44:14     
interfaces and brain machine interfaces they can take the signal do the signal     
44:19     
processing and then put it into a you know into a robot or a mechanical arm     
44:25     
and prod movements in those directions so that's actually quite useful for uh neuroprothetics as well as understanding     
44:32     
this manifold however it is not known whether any manifold structure     
44:37     
underlines the assembly of individual movements into long multi-action sequences moreover it is unclear how     
44:44     
neuronal activity underlying granular behaviors such as grasping is nested     
44:49     
within activity related to course behaviors such as armor so it's like     
44:55     
this sort of you know when we talked about that monkey example or primate example uh there's the arm and then     
45:01     
there's the hand the hand does grasping and then the arm moves so you can tell     
45:07     
you know from the data that we just recorded what direction the arm is moving but then the grasping is a     
45:14     
separate behavior and that involves separate neurons and then we want to know how all of that is coordinated     
45:21     
together in neural activity in the connector so it's very hard to know you     
45:26     
know we might be able to decode say like one component of the behavior but the     
45:31     
other components of the behavior are separate and apart from that but they're coordinated they're synchronized so how     
45:37     
does that happen so we therefore hypothesize that one function of distributed brainwine     
45:44     
activity is to organize patterns of behavior across these different scales in natural context animals must     
45:51     
simultaneously perform many tasks from processing sensory information to     
45:56     
coordinating actions and motor patterns all while maintaining longer term behavioral goals they have to coordinate     
46:02     
all these things in the same sort of sequence of behaviors and the same     
46:08     
sequence of sort of being aware of what's going on so like you know in C     
46:13     
elegance I don't know how much awareness there is but you know they have to coordinate a sequence of movements so     
46:19     
sometimes they have to go a long way to find um you know some sort of food source or     
46:26     
some sort of chemical source sometimes they have to remember locations and they     
46:31     
have to coordinate all of that into their movements so it doesn't just involve a motor circuit that tells the     
46:39     
worm whether to go forwards or backwards there's a lot more to it and so we can     
46:44     
turn to ethological studies which are the studies of animal behavior of the wild that propose this is achieved     
46:51     
through a hierarchical organization of behavior which slower time scale behaviors hierarchically orchestrate     
46:59     
faster time scale behaviors so if you have faster time scale behaviors like if     
47:04     
the sea elegance wants to make a turn or wants to reverse its direction that's a     
47:10     
a fast time scale behavior and but that's orchestrated by slower time scale     
47:16     
behaviors meaning that there's a goal maybe of finding a food source or a chemical source and that goal is     
47:23     
subsumed by these these different components these movements and so you     
47:29     
know it doesn't just happen in a vacuum and thus we should expect the connecttome to have a connectivity that     
47:37     
reflects them it shouldn't just be like the movement circuit operating in     
47:43     
isolation it has to have more inputs and it has to do this in a way that's     
47:48     
structured because you know it's not just adding in stuff adding in activity     
47:54     
it's adding in specific information some studies have identified neural     
48:01     
activity coralates of hierarchical behavioral organization in specific neurons brain regions however how such     
48:09     
hierarchical organization is achieved across the brain and the role of neural manifold in such organization if any is     
48:17     
unknown so um you know again this sort of     
48:22     
real-time behavior um in say like     
48:27     
primates movement changes uh the visual landscape in the opposite direction of the movement this is termed optical flow     
48:35     
so if you're um walking down the hallway your view is changing because you're     
48:43     
moving and that movement is kind of changing the kinds of things you're     
48:48     
interacting with this is something called optical flow they use it in engineering they use it in um sort of     
48:56     
perceptual control theory and in ecological psychology is an organizing     
49:01     
principle because it is important to have this model of sensory inputs not as     
49:07     
these discrete uh moments but as this sort of     
49:12     
continuous process that actually changes how the organism interacts with the     
49:18     
environment in many instances self such self-generation sensory information is     
49:24     
suppressed in the nervous system so this is not always useful but it sometimes is     
49:29     
useful multiple species use it to adjust their movements so for example when     
49:35     
birds uh try to make landing moves in flying or insects try to make landing     
49:40     
moves in flying and sometimes mammals will use it for navigation including     
49:46     
humans additional sensory modalities may also exhibit self-generated signals for     
49:52     
example when nematodeses crawl backwards they sense traces of O2 and CO2 gases     
49:58     
caused by their own metabolism that's an interesting example um overall such sensorydriven activity     
50:06     
is highly correlated to the animals behavior and may be prevalent in the nervous system thus disentangling the     
50:13     
origins of brainwide behavior related activity is required for a comprehensive     
50:18     
understanding of its functions so let's go down to the figures i think those are probably uh     
50:25     
going to be interesting um so what they do in this paper is they     
50:31     
build this pipeline to record and quantify whole brain activity and     
50:37     
behavior in sea elegance so they're doing this whole brain neuronal calcium     
50:43     
fluoresence imaging um in infreely crawling sea elegance so     
50:48     
they're actually recording it because the sea elegance are in a dish on an egg     
50:53     
or surface and they're crawling around and they're getting     
50:58     
information we therefore designed an assay arena where worms freely explore bare aar pads under a cover glass so     
51:06     
they're actually have this under a microscope they have the aar pad here and they have a cover glass on top brain     
51:14     
activity was imaged with high magnification immersion optics and behavior with infrared illumination low     
51:22     
magnification to capture the entire body of signal so um that's how they what they     
51:30     
reported uh they also had transgenic worms and they wanted to use that to     
51:36     
look at different mutants um to overcome the challenge of tracking the small and densely packed     
51:41     
neurons in the deforming tissue of crawling worms we took a segment and     
51:46     
track strategy so of course they had to correct for movement uh     
51:52     
artifact by virtue of the worms moving around they didn't have like you know a     
51:57     
static worm to record so they had to take corrections and they did that I think in     
52:04     
the party we identified a subset of neuronal identities based on their anatomy     
52:10     
position and activity some remaining ambiguities were resolved using neuropal approach for     
52:16     
non-stoastic and unique labeling of neuronal identities so there's this     
52:21     
package neuropal or this approachable neuropal you can use to label uh     
52:27     
neuronal identities um in total we identified 61 neurons which after combining left and     
52:35     
right pairs correspond to 38 neural classes so if you look at the names the     
52:40     
nomenclature of the abdominal neurons you'll see that oftent times you have left neurons and right neurons of the     
52:48     
same name so like ADL is a neuronal pair     
52:53     
or a neuronal class in this case um you have ADL and ADLR left and right so     
53:01     
there's a symmetry between left and right and so this is the way the C elegance connects is organized and named     
53:08     
and so you know each side has a neuron that basically does a similar thing and     
53:15     
you know you can compare those two to see what the difference is in in     
53:20     
sort of bilateral symmetry and oftentimes there are differences not great differences but you know you can     
53:28     
imagine that there are differences in information processing in the conneto that are split down the midline there     
53:35     
are differences on the left and right side but then of course you know so we     
53:40     
can make statements about the left side and the right side in a single data set a subset of     
53:49     
these were identified representing around 40% of track neurons and freely     
53:54     
moving data sets 38% of track neurons in immobilized data sets and 15 around 15%     
54:01     
freely moving GFP data sets which is different than CGP     
54:08     
And you know it's just the different ways of uh recording     
54:14     
information so this is a a figure of kind of what they were doing um they had     
54:21     
these recordings of neurons they were able to find PCA modes     
54:26     
down here and then they were able to correlate that with the speed so they actually had like an a they had a heat     
54:33     
map of normal activity uh so this is 121 track neurons across     
54:39     
time and so these are the each neuron down the y- axis time is from zero to I     
54:47     
guess 500 seconds and you have these behaviors that were identified you had     
54:54     
these PCA modes which are like breaking down the behavior and then these neurons     
55:01     
which had an activity um and then they looked at the PCA CCA     
55:07     
similarity so that is where we have uh normal only only is PCA so this PCA is     
55:15     
actually from the normal activity and then that was mapped to the behavioral activity or the     
55:21     
speed and then continuous behavioral normal which is CCA and discrete     
55:27     
behavioral normal CCA discrete so we have this once we collect the data from     
55:35     
both sources we can like look at PCA the PCA analysis of neuronal activity and     
55:41     
the CCA analysis of this behavioral and normal activity so that's what these     
55:48     
graphs kind of represent and then this graph here C and D which show kind of     
55:53     
the correlation between PCA and CCA and for     
55:59     
different PCA components or PCA modes so you have one through three here and you     
56:04     
have PCA mode one two three so it looks like PCA mode one it has a high degree of PCA CCA     
56:12     
similarity and then the rest of them less so that's I guess kind of true PCA because the first component was always     
56:19     
the strongest although I don't know what they mean by modes here the first     
56:24     
component usually has most of the variation in any case um so let's move     
56:30     
down to C through G or E through G so these graphs represent neuronal     
56:36     
components behavior and neuronal components and discrete behavioral neuronal components so this is the PCA     
56:43     
on the left the CCA in the middle the CCA discrete on the right and you have     
56:49     
so you have PCA versus PCA and I guess this describes the amount of     
56:56     
variation and then this is this I guess this dynamical trace of the activity so     
57:03     
this shows sort of what those look like     
57:09     
um then you have CCA weight for different neurons so you could isolate this down to different neuronal uh     
57:16     
classes so it's like the left and the right so AVA left and AVA right AV left     
57:22     
and AVA right and so forth and so you could take the CCA weight that you're getting from the behavior and the neural     
57:29     
activity mapping it to these specific neurons and then you get this AVA beam I     
57:36     
guess the highest CCA weight and you go down to negative values down these here     
57:44     
so they actually have this broken down by neural     
57:52     
classes and so this is uh figure two this shows the difference between     
57:58     
freely moving and immobilized uh bones so you have freely moving and     
58:04     
immobilized uh contexts where you're recording um so     
58:10     
again this just shows the difference uh that that uh this sort of free moving     
58:15     
paradigm makes really moving of course gives you different activity than     
58:21     
mobile and again we have this map of PC1 weight by neuron neuronal class so we     
58:29     
have AVA and AV at sort of the top of the the highest weights and then you     
58:35     
have negative weights down here for this host of so again we and then we have     
58:40     
this for immobilized and freely moving and so there are differences in some cases between immobilized and freely     
58:48     
moving and some cases less so uh then there's this change in     
58:54     
dimensionality and freely moving so we're just looking at freely moving you have this change in dimensionality by     
59:00     
neural type so you have sensory neurons inter neurons motor neurons interforward     
59:07     
and intra reverse meaning that they're involved in forward reverse movements or inter neurons but they're involved in     
59:13     
these specific behaviors what you see here is you have well uh quite a smattering of     
59:21     
different uh outputs here um you have the motor so     
59:27     
you have motor neurons that are kind of spread across this in terms of their log     
59:33     
p value um and then you have of course the change in dimensionality negative and     
59:41     
positive and so this is just showing for these different I don't see any real pattern here um inter neurons are     
59:49     
interspersed across this graph so are the forward and the reverse um actually     
59:55     
I think the forward may be all positive and the reverse are tending towards negative but I'm not really sure how to     
1:00:03     
interpret this graph in any case I think there a lot of graphs here probably if     
1:00:08     
you go through the paper this is another interesting graph     
1:00:15     
here um this is in figure three this is figure three     
1:00:22     
i'm going to say J or I i'm sorry this is figure 3     
1:00:28     
I zoom in a little bit and so we have     
1:00:39     
um okay um so this is uh freely moving C     
1:00:45     
uh GCP versus free moving GFP and so you can't really tell the colors i guess one     
1:00:51     
is gray and one is purple but um this is hierarchy model performance so I guess     
1:00:58     
this is fitting a hierarchical model behavior this is behavior only model performance so this is comparing these     
1:01:05     
two different types of model performance and then for these different from these different data sets we have four     
1:01:12     
specific cells these results so it looks like you have some neurons that fit     
1:01:19     
neither model and other neurons that fit both models somewhat     
1:01:24     
well so again you have the cells that are labeled and     
1:01:32     
differences between freely moving or GFP and C uh GCM and those are just different ways of     
1:01:39     
measuring it but basically you have this trend towards     
1:01:45     
I guess hierarchy model performance there's more variation there but it's     
1:01:50     
interesting again to see which cells perform differently or different types     
1:01:56     
of model performance and that may tell us maybe you know which cells might be involved in a behavioral hierarchy     
1:02:03     
versus ones that are just maybe more core to this behavior um I don't really     
1:02:09     
know how else to interpret it um this letter K which is of course another part     
1:02:16     
of figure three this shows a radial um graph of     
1:02:24     
uh I guess looking at different points in the worm different points in the behavior so the worm is moving um and     
1:02:32     
it's it's making this undulating movement so different parts of the body     
1:02:37     
are responding differently to the movement so then this is behavioral only     
1:02:42     
model performance so this is looking at I guess how the behavior works in the     
1:02:48     
model um this is like the direction of movement and then these are the cells     
1:02:54     
that are involved in this and I guess these are uh classified by neuron type     
1:03:00     
so we have dorsal motor neurons we have neurons we have vententral motor neurons     
1:03:06     
and they're involve implicated in different angles of movement so we have of course these different points of so     
1:03:14     
as the worm is undulating uh they're moving in different directions different parts of the body and so you can see     
1:03:20     
that there are different neurons involved in those different components of the     
1:03:28     
movement and then of course there's this turning mode measure and then different     
1:03:33     
uh specific neurons here and then their class so they actually show how for     
1:03:39     
turning mode you have some neurons that have a wide amount of variation some     
1:03:45     
with a very tight amount of variation and that some are sort of in negative     
1:03:50     
turning mode and some are in positive turning so this is and of course I think     
1:03:55     
most of the motor vententral neurons are involved in the positive turning mode and most of the dorsal motor neurons are     
1:04:02     
involved in the negative turning as we see here     
1:04:17     
that so yeah so that's pretty much this paper um and this is kind of summarizing     
1:04:26     
we observe rich neuronal dynamics encompassing a large fraction around 80%     
1:04:31     
of all track neurons a striking feature of this neuronal of these neuronal population dynamics are correlations     
1:04:39     
among many sensory inter and motor neuron classes for most neuronal cell     
1:04:44     
types this correlational structure quantified by PC weights which is the     
1:04:50     
principal component analysis we showed earlier was reproducible in immobilized     
1:04:55     
conditions however both conditions showed frequent transitions the correlated activity patterns importantly     
1:05:03     
in the immobilized condition animals were not only deprived of external acute stimula but also lack of any time     
1:05:09     
varying affirant inputs or appropriate reception of their own movements so they     
1:05:14     
didn't get this feedback that they might need from the environment to sort of control their behaviors it's all feed     
1:05:21     
forward which is interest in the immobilized condition which is interesting because there's often this     
1:05:27     
uh you know the celebrated role of feedback in sensory motor control and     
1:05:33     
that it's a such a critical uh source of sort of control meaning that you know if     
1:05:40     
you're moving towards a goal you have to get these corrections constantly or else     
1:05:45     
you you know you can't really make it to your goal you don't get that kind of refined set of movements you     
1:05:52     
need this result supports the idea that these dynamics are intrinsically driven     
1:05:58     
so it may be that you get intrinsic processing instead of constant feedback     
1:06:05     
from the environment this does not exclude that the environment can influence these dynamics and their     
1:06:10     
associated behaviors for example it was shown that constant or only slowly changing arousing factors such as time     
1:06:17     
off food hunger experimental conditions such as excitation light can affect the     
1:06:24     
frequency of behavior brain state transitions so that's interesting that     
1:06:29     
you have these intrinsic dynamics that are providing this feedback to the goal     
1:06:35     
and it's maybe only augmented by things from the environment     
1:06:41     
um and that's you know the assumption is that the environment is really kind of providing every single bit of that     
1:06:48     
feedback however such factors cannot explain exact transition timing and the observed correlational structure     
1:06:55     
dynamics so it's good stuff and um you know this really kind of gives us     
1:07:05     
a view as to these this diverse continuum of behavioral representations in the seal elements brain of course the     
1:07:11     
adult brain and there are a number of     
1:07:17     
implications for sensory processing and really understanding how that works u C     
1:07:22     
elegance has a wide variety of sensory processing largely chemical     
1:07:27     
processing and so this is you know it does a lot of really interesting behaviors with respect to chemical     
1:07:35     
processing they can follow plumes they can follow     
1:07:40     
radiance of different chemicals so they have some really complex behaviors which     
1:07:46     
we might not have thought about um and of course this reflects their natural envirment Right they're in this     
1:07:53     
threedimensional matrix of soil there all sorts of stimuli around them there's     
1:07:58     
rotting fruit there's bacteria in different places or different types of toxins and the idea is they want to be     
1:08:05     
able to stay alive and consume food and move around in that column of soil and     
1:08:11     
reproduce that's their goal and so you know there are a lot of things that they need to do in terms of processing     
1:08:19     
chemical information whom following things like that so um that's all kind     
1:08:25     
of what this has to do it's there's a lot of navigation and a lot     
1:08:32     
of sort of multi-dimensional sensory     
1:08:38     
processing okay so that's I think that's all for that paper and that's pretty much all for today uh do we have any     
1:08:45     
comments before we go anything you want to mention go ahead Susan well nothing i just thank     
1:08:53     
you for the presentation i'm interested in neurons so     
1:08:59     
yeah all right all right talk to you next week thanks say bye bye
