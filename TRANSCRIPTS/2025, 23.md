Hello. Hi. How are you?
0:10
All right. Uh, welcome. So, did you want to give an update or
0:17
discuss some things going on with you or Yeah. Uh so uh last week I did uh some
0:24
analysis on uh the the lineage information which I have uh received from that thing and uh uh
0:33
for me to work on certain things like uh uh I mean like the temporal uh I mean
0:39
like the time where the synthesis has actually evolved. So I've looked into
0:45
some of the analysis and I just did some you know the basic analysis seeing like
0:50
where at what time what centations have been formed and how many of of them have been formed and uh what is the frequency
0:57
where it actually lasted so I was able to look into some of the details as that so
1:06
from my okay hi
1:13
Yeah. Well, that's good. Thank you. All right.
1:20
So, uh, does anyone else have anything? Uh, I don't know if, uh, you've been working
1:26
on the centum stuff. Did you want to talk a little bit more about that?
1:36
Well, I came across a weird paper. Okay. As an animal grows,
1:42
its muscle multi-uclear muscle cells get bigger and then they divide in two.
1:52
Okay. And so, uh, it's it's interesting. They
1:58
did not look at the nuclei, unfortunately. So, we don't know if they're more nuclei or if the nuclei
2:04
divided in two. if they doubled.
2:09
Right. Okay. Yeah. So, it's it's a curious fact. There's
2:15
something about they were looking at muscle cells in mammals, I think.
2:21
Uh and uh it's a curious thing that they may a sensitial cell might behave in
2:29
terms of cell division much like a normal cell. Yeah.
2:35
Okay. But until somebody does the work, we won't know. Right. Leath, I think, has all the information.
2:43
But Bradley, what we're trying to do that's different from what you do is put all of the formation and successive
2:49
steps in sensitia on the same time time scale as uh the previous uh lineage
2:57
tree. Right. Okay. You have the data there, but they're not they're organized
3:03
horizontally rather than vertically. Yeah. Okay. So, uh that's what we're looking
3:09
at. And he's got he's got all the data and corrections from the guy who did the interactive
3:16
uh lineage tree. Yes. So, uh I think we can go ahead we
3:21
go ahead now and make a uh a definitive and how should I say uh it should
3:28
replace this other fellow's tree. Uh the only question remaining is uh whether or
3:36
not he wants to be a co-author on the paper. So,
3:41
you know, it's it's basically a correction and uh addition to his
3:47
interactive lineage tree. Well, Leila thinks it's best to start from scratch rather than get his code.
3:54
Yeah. I'm I don't understand why. Lea, can you explain that? So, probably what uh I mean like he
4:00
actually feeded into the uh the website or the back end. So the databases that
4:05
he used in the previously he did it manually from scratch. I mean like when
4:12
he uploaded into the system. So he collected all these data and he has given to us. I think when we have all
4:17
the data, I mean like I will uh I mean like I would prefer the platform which I use currently to extract the insights
4:24
from it rather than you know taking his I mean like you know the older versions
4:30
of the the technologies and uh
4:36
so it's more like quite old so it's like more like HTML and back end they used uh
4:42
I don't really know details now we use and the visualizations and the kind of
4:48
the user interfaces have been improved a lot in time and they're evolving rapidly. So I think could be good and
4:56
I got you. Okay. Okay. So it's better to start over.
5:03
Yeah. Okay. So that's where we're at. Uh the
5:09
uh uh sensitia are everywhere. We the paper includes a a large list of reports
5:15
of sensitia. Yeah. So, uh uh and this curious paper. Okay,
5:24
I'll look up this paper now. I'll shut up and look it up. So, Susan, are you uh what's going on with you?
5:29
Um sorry, I turned the mic off because Oh, there. And there's nothing wrong with with my
5:37
um microphone. Okay.
5:43
Okay, I'm just busy trying to get you. Um, this paper attributes the muscle growth
5:50
to uh uh mechanical tensions.
5:56
Oh, okay. That sounds good. Now, of course, this is post.
6:02
It's what? Post adult stage or childhood stage. I'm
6:07
not sure. Anyway, it was a surprising result. So I don't know the nematodes do
6:13
this. No, I don't. In fact, yeah, the muscle body wall muscles aren't um centishia.
6:20
Yeah, they're nucleated. So nobody's tried to stretch a neatode.
6:30
You know how to do it. Yeah, you can you can put it in a capillary tube and then use water flow to stretch
6:38
in two directions in a T- tube. Yeah. Put the water down and and if you don't flush the anemode out,
6:44
you stretch. So, it's it would be possible to apply
6:51
forces to anode and see how it responds. Yeah. Okay.
6:57
uh you know there uh oh some of these mechanical probes
7:03
uh they're light light probes that exert forces
7:08
so it might not be out of the question to stretch a nematode anyways I'm
7:13
I'm just randomly looking up things so that I can write um a paper and I've
7:22
done the summary of my thesis but he wants me to do a literature review.
7:28
Oh, okay. Yeah. So, this this fits in with it. Like, why am I looking at this and why is it
7:35
important? Well, we can take a look at these three. Um, I think it's three, right? It's
7:41
four. Yeah. Oh, we'll go over those. Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, let's let's look at those papers.
7:46
Uh, so the first one is the one Dick put in the chat. This is muscle growth by
7:53
sarcomir divisions. So this is from this is from this year. So that's good.
7:59
Oh yeah. That's why that's why I can't follow it up and find out. Yeah. Nobody's done any work I presume at this
8:06
point. Yeah. Yeah. Uh so this is uh on muscle
8:12
growth in I think humans or known Drosophila. Uh this is
8:18
uh so this wouldn't necessarily be uh relevant to C elegance but let's see
8:24
what they have to say. You never know. Well, let's see. Uh the sarccomir is the
8:30
elementary contractile unit of muscles. Uh adult muscle cells are large and
8:35
chain thousands of sarccomirs into long periodic myofibbrals that attach to the
8:42
skeleton. During development, muscle cells must increase in length to maintain the mechanical connection to
8:48
the growing skeleton. So they have to stretch out as the skeleton grows and everything else. And they have to kind
8:55
of maintain that sort of mechanical connection but also the same uh tension
9:01
that they maintain you know as they grow as as the entire body grows. How muscles add new
9:08
sarcimeirs to facilitate muscle growth is unknown. So they need to add in circums.
9:15
Using live imaging and high throughput image analysis, we have now tracked the sarccomir components during the
9:21
developmental growth of your soft muscle and found that individual sarccomirs
9:26
divide along the myophibbral tension axis into daughter's daughter circums.
9:32
So this is where you have this tension axis and this is where you're getting this division of the sarcomirs into
9:40
these uh you know basically they're replicating this way new sarcomirs can be inserted
9:46
into the contractile mechanically intact myofibras. Uh so you know there there's remodeling
9:54
going on but it has to be incorporated into the existing muscle. This kind of poses an interesting problem which is
10:01
the organism is constantly using its muscle um to move but it's also needing
10:08
to remodel it continuously. I mean it muscle tends to remodel continuously
10:13
because it gets damaged as it's used and so there's that aspect but also um
10:20
there's this other aspect of developmental growth. Um,
10:26
we propose that sarcamir division is triggered by tension and local sarcimeir damage. This is what I was referring to
10:33
originating from skeletal growth and muscle contractions. Sarccomir divisions repair damaged
10:40
sarccomirs, ensure their mechanical integrity and synchroize sarccomir
10:45
addition with skeletal growth during animal development. So it looks like this is um figure one is an image of
10:54
kind of what they're dealing with here. This is the Drosophila sarccomir scheme. So this is um similar to the uh sort of
11:03
a malian sarcomir scheme. You don't you know you have the I band
11:09
I bands here you have the zisks over here at the ends and you have the A band
11:15
and the M band. So you have this sort of structure where it's being stretched and pushed together at the ends and then you
11:23
have this middle part that does the stretching. So you have actin filaments in here, you have myasin in here and you
11:32
have obscurin in the middle. So that's the way that you know our muscles are
11:38
structured as humans and as you see the same structure in Drosophila sarums. Now
11:45
these have to be replicated in development. That's what they're referring to. So you have to have this
11:50
uh division and you have to replicate the structure within the cell. Um so
11:56
this is then uh flight muscle length growth. So this is where you get this um
12:03
the muscle cells and they look like they grow outward. you have these tendons that are connected and so these are the
12:09
flight muscles and how they're expanding outward like this.
12:16
Um so this is some staining here showing these this flight muscle growth. So you
12:25
go from 32 hours where you have sort of this and you see this down here in the
12:31
stain at 36 hours it's stretched out 40 hours it gets stretched out more and
12:36
then 48 hour this is the 40hour example and then this is 48 hours
12:42
so you can see that it stretches out quite a bit and it's it's um you know it's larger more robust
12:50
and then uh D is um the stable connection of the flight
12:58
muscles to the tendon cell extensions green lines during the growth phase from
13:03
32 to 40 hours uh post uh after puparium formation. So post piparium. So this is
13:10
again where you get these banding here and you can see the variation.
13:16
Uh then E is the sarccomir addition rate. So how do we keep adding
13:22
sarccomirs to the structure? This is the muscle fiber length on the y- axis and
13:28
you have time on the x- axis and then circum length is a function of muscle
13:33
fiber length and then s the circum rate is a function of that as well. So you
13:40
see that you have the circum length function which is that it's uh
13:46
sort of stable across time but you get the circum rate here and then you get
13:52
this uh muscle fiber length growth here. So this is kind of showing this.
13:59
Is it clear if the uh if the new smears were end to end or parallel?
14:07
Um, I'm not sure. Okay. It's one one thing to try to eat out of this.
14:13
Yeah. You see, I found nothing about nuclei in here. Yeah, they don't really talk about that.
14:19
Um, yeah. So, I guess this is uh flight
14:24
muscle end growth and this is live imaging of this sort of the ends here.
14:31
So you can see up here at the top you have these ends of the flight muscle connected by the tendons. So you have
14:37
the tendons connecting into the muscle and they just image the end and they want to see what happens during growth.
14:43
So you see that there's this uh as you they're using this GFP reporter
14:50
and it stretches basically it stretches out over 180 minutes
14:55
23.2 2 microns. And you can see this here zoomed in where you have the Zbands
15:02
that are identified here and they get stretched out like that.
15:09
Um and then uh in figure three they just
15:15
talk about their automated detection tool. Figure four is sarcamir detection
15:22
reveals sarccomir division by meiosin segregation. So again you're getting
15:27
this these circum divisions by the segregation of meosin. Uh you can see in
15:33
here we have these different uh molecules that are stretching out as as
15:40
this process happens. Sarcamir division into two daughter cells. So I'm trying
15:47
to figure out what's going on in this figure. We have so you have actin, salamus, obscurin,
15:56
meosin
16:02
and measin. So those are the four and then each of these graphs kind of show
16:08
um their uh difference between Z1, M and Z2. So Zband one and Zband 2 and then M
16:17
in the middle. And so you can see that the obscurin increases in the middle. Uh
16:24
actin is maximized at Z1 and Z2. Salamus as well. And then measin is also in the
16:31
middle with um obscuring but there's a little bit different profile to it. And
16:38
you can see as you move across the band you see that there's this difference in
16:44
these molecules. So that suggests that there's this sort of segregation of the uh sarccomir into two sort of
16:52
cells that these molecules are moving towards the ends. You can see by the time you get to this
16:59
part of the band, you can see it with you. This is weird. Um
17:05
this part of the band that the profile is quite different than at the beginning. So you see this in the stain
17:14
here where you have this difference in how the molecules are distributed
17:21
and so forth. So that's what they're showing there. And then uh this one here
17:28
is live imaging of sarcimeir division. So this just shows over 14 minutes kind
17:34
of what we have here. So we have um these images where
17:43
things get farther apart. Yeah. And then this is uh the larville circum
17:50
here Z discks in 3D. So they're doing some 3D modeling of this microscopy image. So they have the Z1, the Z2, and
17:58
the Z3. And they're just showing in this uh circum zisks in site two.
18:08
So it gets interesting. Uh they have a discussion here. Um they talk a little
18:13
bit about uh sort of how so they identify a sarcimeir
18:20
division mechanism that allows the addition of new sarcimeirs into existing myopibs anywhere along the growing
18:27
muscle fiber. This is fundamentally different uh than their end hypothesis
18:33
which they started with which proposed that new circums are exclusively inserted at the terminal zisks of muscle
18:40
fiber ends. So instead of being inserted at the ends and then pushing everything
18:45
over they kind of insert wherever they can't into the into the uh scheme. And
18:52
and so the ladder may still apply under certain circumstances which by the latter they mean the end hypothesis
19:00
but would require the transport of all newly synthesized sarccomir components to the muscle fiber ends and the damage
19:06
to be limited to the ends. Okay. And then they talk about sort of how these additions are regulated.
19:14
Every circum division requires the controlled breakage of protein protein interaction bonds
19:21
uh without an uncontrolled break of the entire myrrofiber. We propose that controlled damage is
19:27
triggered by the high mechanical tension which is built up by skeletal growth that stretches the attached muscles
19:35
while they keep contracting. So there's this tensile force that's managing this
19:41
this growth process. So as the organism uses its muscles and as the organism is
19:47
growing there's this tensile force that that sort of triggers this process.
19:53
So and then when growth stops there's still damage to the muscles that's being
19:59
used but it's less uh it doesn't trigger this process.
20:06
uh as a consequence tensile forces in the sarcimeir increase homogeneously along the myophibbrals
20:13
till a threshold is passed and a sarcimeir division is triggered where the zipper progresses forward. Um so
20:20
that's kind of what their hypothesis is here. Um and so this division initiation
20:29
creates free binding sites that allow the recruitment of new sarcimeir proteins making the division process
20:35
irreversible. During the entire process measin can still interact with actin filaments
20:41
which prevents the uncontrolled rupture of the entire microfiber. Last the centrally located actin and z
20:49
disk components establish a new zisk between the segregated meosin stacks and
20:55
then establishment of a new zisk. So they show the sarcimeir division model in figure seven and they show that
21:02
there's this structure where you have what we saw in the first figure we have
21:08
the ends and the central part. So you have the I bands and the A band in the middle and you have this high tension
21:15
outward. So the tension is coming from the organism growing and it's stretching
21:20
the circum out. This then builds this tension builds up. You get this division
21:26
initiation and that releases the tension because there's something new being formed in this space. So it expands this
21:33
space and it lessens the tension. So you see that this is kind of this I band and
21:39
the A bands are here and they get stretched and then eventually you get a new I band A band I band combination and
21:46
then that releases the tension because there's more there in the middle and so that's what we have here. But to do this
21:53
to to have this division we need novel protein recruitment and then you need to
21:59
actually establish a new zisk al together. So this is where you get this
22:05
now you have two of these I band A band I band structures with a Z disk
22:11
separating them and now the tension is lower and then that process will repeat
22:16
as the organism grows further and it stretches on it some more.
22:22
So that's that paper that's an interesting paper kind of talking about how these structures get formed.
22:29
Now in C elegance we don't have this kind of structure for muscle you know they're not
22:36
centishium they're body wall muscles so they're independent cells they divide
22:42
and then form this body wall and there a lot of centissum around it um but there
22:49
basically I think the cells just grow in place and then start to exhibit
22:55
twitching and then they they start to work together But this is in Drosophila. In
23:02
Drosophila, you get a model that's similar to what you see say in mammals.
23:09
So it's interesting. Yeah, they don't talk about the uh you know they talk about the the part
23:15
about the sarccomir divisions and it's just basically guided by this tension
23:22
that's happening as a consequence of growth. So yeah and I don't know like it's
23:29
interesting some of the centum we see in sea elegance are those driven by similar
23:35
forces. So in other words, you know, we saw last week where you have this process of
23:40
these developmental cells forming precursor cells that fuse and then you
23:47
have bronzuclear division and you have this cential structure that's growing
23:54
with the organism and it's growing kind of in place along it's the one that we saw last week was
24:03
assembled you know kind of in the laral development. So the the worm is out of the egg. It's it's moving around. It's
24:10
experiencing tension. And so what is the role of tension in that building that
24:15
structure? I'm not sure. It's a deterministic structure because you see it in the lineage tree as a
24:21
consequence of lineage tree and it's basically the same in every sele
24:27
but you know it's got to kind of grow with the organism and and be built as the laral organism is behaving and
24:36
growing in size.
24:42
Okay. Do we have any questions on that?
24:54
Um so let's get to the paper Susan um brought up.
25:00
So the first one here is this cytokeleletal pre-stress.
25:05
So this is in cytokeleton journal Koboken. Um and this is from 2021. So
25:12
this is um something they call pre cytokeleletal
25:18
pre-stress the cellular hallmark in mechanobiology and mechano medicine. So
25:23
this is a review paper. Um so basically
25:29
their hypothesis is that increasing evidence demonstrates that mechanical forces in addition to soluble molecules
25:37
impact cell and tissue functions and physiology of diseases.
25:42
How living cells integrate mechanical signals to perform appropriate biological functions is an area of
25:48
intense investigation. Here we review the evidence of the central role of cytokeleletal
25:54
pre-stress, mechanuction and mechanobiology. Elevating cytokeleletal pre-stresses
26:01
increases cell stiffness and reinforces cell stiffening, facilitates longrange
26:07
cytoplasmic mechanuction via integrins. Enables direct chromatin stretching and
26:13
rapid gene expression. Spurs embryionic development and stem cell differentiation.
26:19
It boosts immune cell activation and killing tumor cells. Whereas lowering lowering cytokeleletal pre-stress
26:26
maintains embryionic cells stem cell potency promotes tumor genenesis and
26:32
meta metastasis of cell like uh stem cell like malignant tumor repopulating
26:38
cells and elevates drug delivery efficiency of soft tumor cell derived microparticles. So basically they the
26:46
way they envision it is it controls a lot of different things in terms of growth in terms of stresses on the
26:54
organism as it's growing and then some things having to do with cell differentiation whether that be stem
27:01
cells or cancer cells. And um you know there's a lot of mechanical stuff going
27:07
on there that sort of uh informs especially in mammals what the cell
27:13
might become or you know whether say cells adhere to a surface or what have
27:19
you. So it's a really interesting I mean you know they're kind of saying that controls a lot that this phenomena is
27:26
the root of a lot of things in cell biology and in development.
27:33
The overwhelming evidence suggests that the cytokeleletal pre-stress is the governing principle and the cellular
27:40
hallmark of mechanobiology. The application of mechanobiology to medicine or mechano medicine is rapidly
27:47
emerging and may help advance human health and improve diagn diagnostics,
27:53
treatment and therapeutics of diseases. So this again is a review article. They
27:58
kind of give some figures here. uh they just show one here of the different
28:04
cytokeleletal pre-stresses and this is just kind of a summary of what they're talking about. So um this is where they
28:13
talked about stem cells, malignant tumor cells, mechanuction
28:19
and immune cells and microparticles. And so in this stem cells example you
28:25
have pre-stress mediated fate determination. So we have of course this phenomenon
28:31
called pur potency or multi- potency where by a cell stem cell or a precursor
28:38
cell has a number of fates that can uh go down you know like you have muscle
28:45
precursors, you have neural precursors and you have stem cells that are sort of
28:50
um you know muscle stem cells or neural stem cells. And so at every step they
28:56
have this set of fates that they can um achieve and in say like in uh regulative
29:04
development which we don't talk about much with C elegance there's some of that but in those cases you have this
29:11
sort of uh these cell fates that are controlled by chemical cues and what
29:16
they're arguing is that mechanical cues also play a very important role in
29:21
achieving these fates. So they have pre-stress here which limits the or
29:27
determines the fate at least partially. And so that's the case for stem cells.
29:34
Uh for malignant uh tumor cells you have this malignant cell softness where you
29:41
have tumor cell self-renewal and you have these pre-stresses
29:46
which enable this proc process or or return this process.
29:51
Um then we have mechanuction. So we have this uh pre-stress and again
29:59
with mechanotransduction pre-stress actually increases the range of things going on. So you have an
30:07
isotropic gene activation, chromatid stretching and gene upregulation,
30:14
long range stress propagation and enzyme activation, substrate stiffness sensing
30:20
and cell stiff. So as you get this pre-stress mechanuction
30:26
increases and then with immune cells and microparticles you get this pre-stress mediated immune
30:33
cell activation and killing tumor cells. You have a microparticle uptake function
30:39
and you have a microparticle release function. So as you can imagine the
30:44
uptake is where you increase the number of microparticles the release is where you get rid of them and then that
30:50
affects the pre or pre-stress affects these. So as pre-stress increases uptake
30:55
decreases as pre-stress increases release increases that's earth
31:02
then these are this is their sort of diagram of how this works. So you get these external stresses and this is the
31:09
membrane here uh plasma membrane you have these different things happening at
31:15
the membrane. You have growth factors signaling uh cascades being induced. You
31:21
get these ion channel uh mediated things with pas one which is a ion channel that
31:28
is explicitly involves forces and sensing mechanical phenomena.
31:34
you have cadherins and other things at the membrane and then those signals get
31:40
propagated into the nucleus. Uh ectomyiosin pre-stress comes from these
31:45
things that get propagated from the membrane down to the nucleus. Then the nucleus of course uh is affected by
31:53
chromatin being stretched and then genes being activated. So you get these uh
31:59
these these forces that are communicated into the cell through the membrane. They
32:05
trigger processes in the nucleus that allow for gene activation and activating
32:11
muscle stress dependent cell or genes and other types of processes.
32:18
So that's the hypothesis they have. So u this is a nice review paper.
32:25
And then we have this other paper that Susan posted from biohysical journal. This is mechanochemical signaling direct
32:33
cell shape change. So this is very similar in terms of the model that mechanochemical signaling is doing this
32:39
work to affect the cell its uh you know it's its phenotype and in this case cell
32:47
shape change. So they're attributing this mechanochemical signaling to at
32:53
least they're attributing at least part of that effect to mechanochemical signal. Uh so this is the abstract for
33:01
specialized cell function as well as active cell behaviors such as division, migration and tissue development. Cells
33:09
must undergo dynamic changes in shape. To complete these processes, cells
33:14
integrate chemical and mechanical signals to direct force production. This mechanochemical integration allows for
33:22
the rapid production and adaptation of leading edge machinery and migrating cells, the invasion of one cell into
33:29
another during cell fusion, and the force feedback loops that ensure
33:34
cytochinesis. Quantitative understanding of cell mechanics coupled with the protein
33:40
dynamics that exist has allowed us to account for furrow ingression during
33:45
cytochinesis. A model cell shape change process. At the core of cell shape changes is the
33:53
ability of the cell's machinery to sense mechanical forces and tune the force generating machinery is needed. Force
34:00
sensitive cytokeleletal proteins inclus including meiosin two motors and acting
34:06
cross linkers accumulate in response to internally generated and externally
34:12
opposed mechanical stress. So this is you know where you're getting shape changes and things like that where
34:18
you're getting activity within say the cell that's affecting uh shape but also
34:24
you're getting these external stresses and external forces and those are kind
34:29
of contributing to this. Um the physical theory behind how these proteins display
34:36
mechanosensitive accumulation has allowed us to predict parallel specific behaviors of different
34:44
cross-linking proteins and identify a zone of optimal actin binding affinity
34:50
that allows for mechanical stress induced protein accumulation. So they're interested in paralogues
34:56
which are these types of genes that have a specific evolutionary relationship
35:02
and they're so they're they're hypothesizing that this is something that you see widely across species.
35:11
Um these molecular mechanisms coupled with the mechanical feedback systems that exist in cells ensure robust shape
35:19
changes but if they go ary they are poised to promote disease states such as
35:24
cancer cells metastasis and loss of tissue integrity. Oh,
35:31
set of papers. I don't know exactly. That's the sound splitter. They just described it.
35:40
Can you put that reference in the uh Yeah, it should be the second one that
35:45
Susan posted. Uh yeah. Well, let's see up here. Uh
35:53
this Oh, that's maybe not. There's a lot of stuff in the channel.
35:58
So, um this is M let's see mechanochemical signaling direct cell
36:04
shape change. So, it's this one here um by
36:09
uh Schiffhauser and Robinson 2017. Okay.
36:14
Species. Uh I don't know if there's a specific species. I think this is just kind of a
36:20
general model that they're describing. So, this is the sort of their first
36:25
figure. This is where they talk about the structure of cortex determining the
36:30
shape. They so this is I think generally cross species.
36:35
Um yeah they don't talk about a spec well they talk about well they talk about things like dictium but that's
36:42
like a general kind of like these are and then they talk about mamlian cell types.
36:48
Um so it's I think it's a general kind of approach to this. Um, first they tell
36:54
you you're wrong, then they tell you it isn't important, then they tell you we always knew it.
37:02
Shower and Robinson. Yeah. Yeah, that's what this is. Okay.
37:08
But yeah, I mean it's uh Yeah, I think it's just kind of a general kind of
37:13
theory and uh animal cells of course.
37:21
Yeah. delightful. I'm glad to.
37:32
So, it looks like we have a lot of stuff in the chat here that I didn't see. So, let's go over that. Um, yeah. Well, this
37:39
is this is Hildebran, Holton, Supermani,
37:44
etc. This is from 2017. I guess this is Susan as well. the ecadherin
37:51
and modal 2 complex organizes actin filaments required for the epithelial
37:57
hexagonal packing and blastosis attaching and I again it's probably a
38:03
more general paper on development so that's again this very uh specific
38:11
model of uh actin filaments in cells
38:18
um then there's is this uh paper here stem cell mechano adaptation to
38:25
microtubial stabilization and substrate compliance effects on cytokeleletal modeling this one here is um I guess
38:35
it's a two so there's probably a mechano adaptation one
38:40
okay but that's okay so that's that paper uh then there's negative tension control stability and structure of
38:47
intermediate filament networks. So this is about negative tension
38:52
uh again and then this is sharing cells. This is a paper from Dick and Natalie
38:59
and collection. Okay. Sheared drops in pennate datom. So
39:06
this is in datoms where they're doing sheared droplets. What is that? Uh what were the lessons from that paper? Uh
39:15
I heard a a talk on actually it was on paint drops that are put into a flow
39:23
which is coming up in the water and then it stretches in one direction and
39:30
compresses in the other. So you can actually change the shape of a a drop
39:35
that's suspended at the point in the middle. Okay. So it's a very gentle stretch and
39:43
compression making the thing elongated. And I made that an analogy with uh
39:50
datoms that are in flowing streams. Okay.
39:56
Okay. Yeah. So, uh it's just an analogy at this point,
40:02
but uh uh the uh the flow the the flow pattern would allow one to
40:08
try to stretch a neatode. You can put a nematode in there and apply gentle
40:14
stretching forces to it and see what happens, right? Because it's already elongated, so it
40:20
should orient nicely in the flow, right? Yeah.
40:27
Okay. Now, I put another one in here. Uh I think it's further down. Uh
40:34
this is where we uh compressed axelottle embryos and we got a weird effect.
40:42
If you compress them, I think for six hours, you put between two glass plates, they
40:49
end up arched backwards. In other words, I'm not sure how it illustrates, but
40:55
this is the head and this is the tail and the whole embryo is shaped. It's
41:00
concave. Okay. So, it was an interesting
41:05
observation. We didn't do anything more than publish this abstract. The ab I put
41:11
the whole abstract in there, right? Yeah. Oh, the whole Yeah, the text of
41:16
it. Yeah. Yeah. the whole text of the abstract. All right.
41:22
It was a curious result. I don't think anyone's repeated it. Uh
41:27
but uh the uh it's called kyphosis. I think uh
41:35
uh babies are occasionally born with this defect. very rarely but uh uh it
41:43
it's a major defect of an embryo uh simply caused by impressing the
41:50
embryo uh for a few hours.
41:56
Yeah. Yeah. That's like the paper we saw for the inducing of centissium in C elegance
42:05
where you have like you compress the embryo and you can get centishia.
42:13
Um it's also fits in with what I saw with my um
42:22
axelottles that I crossed two morphos and they um produced
42:30
um little hatchlings that were bent 90 degrees. The tail was bent 90 degrees
42:37
from the body and they had a very small and which direction
42:43
seal. Was that Were they Was it bent left, right, or up, down?
42:50
Uh, left, right? Oh, that's peculiar. Okay. Yeah. Well, they were weird. They didn't
42:56
survive. The only one that really survived was the fourhortened one.
43:03
Okay. Uh, they named it Squishy. Squishy. He named it Squishy. This is Elizabeth.
43:11
See, I think all of these papers are tending towards solving a problem which uh is
43:17
outstanding in embryo embryology and that is
43:22
how is the shape of the embryo formed. Yes.
43:28
And and I'm pretty sure axelottle it depends on the blastoil.
43:36
Oh yeah. I mean it's a accumulative effect of all stages but uh
43:42
uh you know we have theories of differentiation but we don't really have
43:48
proper theories of morphagenesis. Okay. uh and I suspect one could get at
43:57
this by uh by measuring
44:03
the forces and the stretch and the uh how should I say the strain stress and
44:10
strains in embryos. Uh the strain is easy to measure because
44:16
it's just a uh the distance between two cells changing over time. Uh The stress
44:23
is hard to measure because you got to get something in there and measure the force,
44:31
right? Yeah. Or you have to know the elasticity of um Oh, yeah. Yeah. You do. Yeah. Do a
44:38
proper mechanical analysis. But strain is easy to measure. Yes. Because it's just how much it it
44:46
stretches. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh,
44:52
you know, if we could ever get a strain map over next level embryo during development, uh, might be able to make
44:59
some headway with this. Yeah. Now, you'd have to use the um, atomic
45:05
um, force microscopy. No, no, you just have to do you just
45:12
have to be able to identify two cells anywhere in the embryo. Oh, you just
45:17
want to do the strand. Oh, yeah. Yeah, strand. Yeah, you just have to identify.
45:23
So, you can follow two cells. Then you can make a strain map.
45:28
You can do a strain map over the whole embryo. Okay. Yeah.
45:34
Okay. So, uh it's approachable but difficult.
45:43
Yes. Unfortunately, the
45:49
little microscopes I've got in my the ball microscope
45:54
uh are not um decent resolution. Oh, you can't track cells with them.
46:01
Well, they're you can, but they're they end up being blurred and like
46:08
there's no depth of field and there's um
46:14
they're like three megapixels maybe like I'd like them to be a 14 megapixel
46:21
camera. Oh, okay. Yeah, you have to get that new uh telescope
46:27
which does uh how big of an image Many g many gigabytes.
46:32
Yeah. Yes. I I need something like that. And it's um then nobody's thinking
46:39
small. Oh, we have to look at the universe.
46:45
Yeah. Well, you know, it'll only pick up a billion galaxies at once. Yeah.
46:51
I want a few axelottal cells. Yep.
46:59
Oh, well. Yeah, one we used uh out of desperation
47:04
was to do pseudo color. Okay, you make a take your grayscale
47:11
image, turn it into a pseudo color image and then look for uh color patches
47:18
moving. Uh another thing is to uh use
47:23
embryos that are lightly pigmented so you can follow pigment patches.
47:28
Yeah. I'll just have to persuade Saskottle to sell me some of their their interesting
47:36
um breeds. Oh, okay. Yeah, they they have one that's sort of
47:41
a a brown modeled the Oh, really? modeled one. And I wondered what it
47:49
would look like. Yeah. Yeah. We we used uh uh white, I
47:56
think. Yeah. white lucistic um they call them lucistic
48:05
white um white skin black eyes. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's
48:11
Yeah, they're you can see the cells um better with those.
48:18
And that's what I've got actually. I've got a pair of those right now. Good. Yeah. So, but that only gives me one
48:25
batch of eggs. So, I hope they survive this summer. But
48:30
anyway, I'm still trying to approach Saskottle
48:36
as in Saskatchewan axelottle only they shortened
48:41
everything.
48:47
Anyway, anyway, I I I think as I said, I think all these papers are tending towards
48:54
solving that problem. It's uh uh how does an embryo pre-stress? How does it
49:00
how does the stress affect morphagenesis and differentiation?
49:06
Uh these are all unsolved problems right now.
49:11
Yeah. Anyways, uh I'm um
49:17
researching this for my my modeling uh paper that I'm hopefully going to get
49:24
written this summer. Anyway, yeah. So,
49:33
that's great. Thank you. Yeah, thanks for the papers. Um, and uh, so that and
49:40
I'm glad that they all had a theme.
49:47
I think that's it for today. Uh, thanks for attending. Let's see.
49:59
I should try to come up north and visit you, Dick. Oh, yeah. We're far north.
50:08
Okay. Uh
50:22
oh, here. Let me throw one more paper in. Okay. You may have already seen this. I'm not
50:27
sure. Uh where is it? Here.
50:38
Oh yeah, we we talked about this I think in a meeting. Oh yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah.
50:44
Yeah. Yeah. It's a good paper we're talking about.
50:50
Still waiting for Michael Leven's reaction, but Well, that's supposed to be like a
50:56
response to Mike Leven's work or Oh, yeah. Exactly. I've been trying to get him to write this paper for decades.
51:02
Oh, okay. Thanks for attending. All right. Bye.
51:09
Okay. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Okay. Uh I wanted to mention a few other things uh for today's meeting. The
51:17
first is that uh on Friday got an update on our Google sum of code projects
51:24
and giadratha who is working on evograph he's working on these temporal graphs.
51:31
He's been exploring conneto data and for C elegance you have a lot of nice open
51:38
source conneto data people collected uh different types of data sets as we'll
51:45
discuss that characterize different aspects of the sea elegance connect them
51:50
so it could be the chemical connections of synapses the electrical connections
51:55
of gap junctions the male connetohapite conneto
52:01
the extra synaptic conneto. We'll talk about those in a minute, but this is a
52:07
resource from openworm.org. It's called the conneto toolbox. So this
52:12
is uh hosted by open and was built by I think it was Craig
52:20
Gleon's group at UCL University College of England.
52:25
And so this overview kind of collects all of the open data sets that exist and
52:32
puts them together in one place and then shows kind of the relationship between these data sets.
52:39
So um let's go down here. So this shows kind of what you can do with these data.
52:45
As you may know um gap junction connetos
52:50
of C elegance look slightly different than the connetos that involve synapses or these chemical
52:57
conetos. You have extra synaptic connetos like neuropepadic connetos and those are
53:04
going to look different still. So you can represent connecttoms using these uh
53:10
these hive plots or these circuit diagrams, these graph matrices or these network
53:18
visualizations.
53:25
And so historically you know there have been different types of connetos.
53:31
We have the anatomical conneto which is the chemical or electrical conneto. So
53:37
chemical again is synaptic connections. Electrical is gap junctions and those
53:42
have been well defined since the late 70s. Uh then there's the extra synaptics.
53:48
These are things going on outside the syninnapse or near the syninnapse. So you have neuropepadic contos and things
53:56
like that. Again, these are just things happening in the C elegance brain that
54:01
contribute to the conneto. We can characterize these sorts of things. Then we have gene
54:07
protein expressions. That's yet another set of data. This is the uh gene and
54:13
protein expression that's affecting the conneto either individual cells or the
54:19
connections between cells. And then the functional conneto which of course in
54:25
connetoics is distinct from the structural conneto which we might classify as an.
54:32
So we have this list of historical publications. We start with uh Elbertson
54:38
Thompson in 1976. We go to White in 1986.
54:44
Uh we go to Durban in 1987. Holland Russell 1991.
54:50
Then we go on Vshi Cook. Varsny did a
54:55
gap junction conneto. Cook did a male conneto where actually I think they did
55:00
both the male and the mafhrodite conne to show the differences between the two.
55:05
Uh so there's cook 2019 cook 2020 and then Britain at all 21 and whit fleet at
55:12
all 21. The whitley um reference is interesting because it involves laral
55:21
development. It involves getting a conneto called the laral world chemical
55:27
conneto and looking at how the synapse synaptic connections change across laral
55:33
stages. So we've used this in a paper already in our in our group and I know
55:40
that Jadroth is particularly interested in this data set. So that's um those are
55:47
the anatomical connetoms. Those were the first connetos to be defined.
55:53
The next set of connetoms of course comes from out of white 1986 and it's
55:58
the functional connetos. uh these are kind of recent where you
56:03
have uh these references in the 2020s
56:09
and you know those are interesting they have data sets associated with them.
56:15
Another set of connetos is the extra synaptic conneto which also comes from
56:20
white's work in 1986 as well as Albertson and Thompson. Uh
56:25
and these were started in they started collecting these in 2013. Serrano sees
56:32
uh and then of course we have gender um atlas and Hobart Bentley in 2016 or Poly
56:40
Sanchez in 2023. Those are all this extra synaptic and again these are
56:46
things like neuropepadic contos. So it's very different um type of conneto
56:54
just based on that criteria. And then of course we have gene protein expression
57:00
altune 2009 uh they proposed sort of this first
57:05
draft of the conneto and then you have Taylor ye and eats 2023 and those are
57:12
all kind of thinking about the
57:17
the gene and gene expression and protein expression complements of each cell in the connective.
57:25
And so they've done some interesting things in how to view the data. They have the data sets here. So if you're
57:31
interested data sets, you can get access to them. And so this is um all sort of
57:38
provided by openworm. And the whole point of this is to make this easier for people working on these types of
57:44
projects to get access to the data.
57:52
Okay. Okay, the next thing I want to talk about is a a fun blog post. Um,
57:57
this is from bluejade.com. This is fiserum explanation. And this is
58:06
how, you know, they're thinking about how to do biological modeling or maybe
58:12
more to the point organic simulations. And so they're thinking about this has a
58:19
long history in computer science. If you go back to the Boyd's algorithm by
58:25
Reynolds or you go back to some of the early computer graphics work is based
58:31
kind of on this organic looking thing. And you know we wanted to kind of move away from these highly pixelated highly
58:39
artificial looking uh graphics and have things like flows and have things like
58:45
pearl and noise and have things that look like life. So you had the voids
58:50
algorithm, you had some early aife algorithms, you had swarming and flocking simulations
58:58
that built upon voids. You had other kinds of organic simulations of like
59:05
axonal growth and other things. So these are all things we can implement in algorithms. They look like life because
59:12
they're based on living systems. And so this just kind of talks about how
59:18
to build algorithms to do these kind of interesting organic simulations and one of them is modeling the slime
59:26
fiserum. So that's what they're going to talk about in this article. So the purpose of this article is to
59:32
explain techniques that enabled me the author of this to make simulations like
59:38
the one below. So if you look at the simulation
59:43
looks like it's a flow it's it's a fiserum a slime it's propagating flows
59:50
in here then again we're just you know there's this qualitative aspect of it that does it look like life does it look
59:57
like something that is a living system and you know I guess you could say yes
1:00:02
because it's your intuition you've seen you know living systems you've seen slime mold you've seen bacterial
1:00:09
cultures, you've seen different biological processes playing out in front of you, so you can tell if
1:00:15
something looks organic or lifelike or not. And so this is what they're kind of getting at. So it's it's very, you know,
1:00:22
it's artistic, it's scientific, it's also very intuitive. And so I don't mean
1:00:27
to say that this is like um you know we can use all these techniques for
1:00:34
scientific simulation but they do have some value in scientific simulation.
1:00:43
So we will focus on algorithmic techniques for artistic purpose rather than scientific meaning. So this is uh
1:00:49
the first example. This is the fiserum algorithm with Jeff Jones and this was
1:00:54
produced in 2010. Jeff Jones presented a simulation algorithm that reproduces the behavior
1:01:01
of organisms such as viserum always found. It is explained in this paper
1:01:08
which is this uh paper characteristics of pattern
1:01:14
formation and evolution and approximations of fiserum transports.
1:01:23
And so just as a sort of to get a sense of what the results look like, they look
1:01:28
like this. These are fiserum colonies, but they could just as easily
1:01:34
be like blood vessels or cells in an array. So you know, we we don't we could
1:01:42
describe this in a lot of ways. If you just show this and don't put a label on it, people might make different guesses
1:01:48
as to what it is, but it's lifelike in the sense that it looks like something that could be produced by a living
1:01:55
system. So the general principle behind this kind of simulation is that particles or
1:02:03
what we might call agents move around leaving a trail behind them and then try
1:02:08
to follow the trails they detect. So this is like very much like a ant
1:02:14
optimization elbow where you have ants and they're moving around the space.
1:02:20
They when they move they leave a pheromone trail and if they're successful say finding food that
1:02:26
pheromone trail is followed and then the successful trails reinforced by other
1:02:31
agents and then you end up with this network of trails that are reinforced
1:02:37
because they're they lead they they have some they lead to something. They do
1:02:43
enforcement, you know, because the say maybe the locations of food in the environment are
1:02:49
random, there's this stochasticity to them as well as the behaviors of
1:02:55
different agents following either the original trail or blazing. So
1:03:00
there's this stochastic component which makes things look likely.
1:03:05
So this is just the simple algorithmic principle though which is all you need are some agents. You put them on a grid
1:03:13
and then they just move around and then they reinforce each other's behavior. So they follow simple interaction rules and
1:03:20
then from that you get these different patterns that emerge that form and they
1:03:25
look flake because they follow these kind of principles of maybe living
1:03:31
agents doing things. um behave. So this is an interactive explanation of a
1:03:38
single agent without representing the trail update. So you can see this um
1:03:43
this is the simulation here where it's kind of the agent is moving and it's
1:03:48
moving into these different positions and you can see that this is unfolding
1:03:54
on a grid. So you get this pattern that emerges as it moves around the grid and
1:04:00
then you have a lot of agents in parallel doing the same thing.
1:04:05
So detailed description of this algorithm is a large number of agents moving in a two-dimensional space. Each
1:04:13
iteration of the algorithm, agents deposit a trail on an image called a trail map, which is this green and and
1:04:22
light green and white array up here just by adding a value to the pixel of an
1:04:28
image. In the above illustration, each cell represents a pixel on the trail map
1:04:34
trail map image. So of course the agents have to have some two-dimensional position represented in X and Y and then
1:04:42
an orientation which is a heading or an angle of movement. So those are the agent attributes
1:04:49
and then there these different steps for iterating the algorithm. So there's the sensing step where the agent looks ahead
1:04:56
three places. The uh distance is defined by the
1:05:02
parameter sensor distance. of each place has a distance that is estimated.
1:05:08
The site angle asks a parameter called sensor angle and then the agent deta detects the trail intensity at these
1:05:15
three positions or pixels. So there's this prediction that's made there's this
1:05:21
distance that's calculated this angle and then there's this sort of estimation
1:05:26
of what happens if this action is taken.
1:05:32
So that's the sensing. Then there's the rotation and movement step which is where there's an evaluation
1:05:39
of making a move and then executing.
1:05:45
So this is where you're getting this actual action and it's not just an
1:05:52
estimation now it's actually doing something. Then you have this deposit step where the agents added value to the
1:05:58
trail map at their new position. This is like depositing a pheromone in the ant colony optimization algorithm but
1:06:05
instead just kind of leaving a memory trace in the environment. They call this stigmary or you know the sort of uh
1:06:15
extra agent memory and so it's a way not only to deposit information for the
1:06:21
agent itself but other agents can follow that information. The fourth uh part of this algorithm is
1:06:29
trail diffusion and decay. So this is where the trail after deposit becomes
1:06:35
diffused. As time goes by, it decays and so you know we don't want to keep this
1:06:42
trace around forever. We want to keep it around for a little while because the environment changes. And if you keep
1:06:49
every trace, first of all, you can't distinguish between any one valuable
1:06:54
trace versus any other trace. Uh and secondly, sometimes those traces
1:07:00
become irrelevant over time. So we don't want to have false information in the
1:07:06
environment, hence the diffusion and decay. And remember, we're implementing this with a computer. So um you know
1:07:13
that we're limited by how things actually happen in nature. We have to use common mechanisms that we can
1:07:20
represent in a computer. We can represent diffusion rates and decay rates pretty easily in a computer. But
1:07:27
you know implementing something um else I don't know what it would be
1:07:33
that life might do that's a little bit different story.
1:07:39
So this is real interactive implementation with a few agents. This is showing the sensor distance, sensor
1:07:46
angle, rotation angle, move distance. So if we increase move distance, we get
1:07:52
this different behavior. We get this faster behavior. It's more frenetic looking sensor distance. As it
1:07:59
increases, they all segregate out into one part of the grid. Sensor angle, if we decrease
1:08:06
that, we get this uh if we increase it you
1:08:12
don't appreciatively change the behavior the rotation angle we change the behavior a little bit but
1:08:19
really sensor distance is the thing that's really affecting this and you can see that now I've
1:08:25
formed these parameter values I form the single lane of the agent moving and this
1:08:32
sharp gradient of uh a signal and so this is Interesting how you can change
1:08:38
these macro parameters by changing the parameters for each agent in parallel.
1:08:45
And so that's okay. So then there's 30 the second one is 36 points by Sage Jensen. This was from 2019 to 2022.
1:08:54
This is a more complex version of this first algorithm where it shows these
1:08:59
different varied behaviors. Um and so he uses a single algorithm and
1:09:05
each point represents different parameters which result in different behaviors. A point corresponds to a
1:09:11
behavior obtained with 20 parameters. So mathematical project shows 36 points of
1:09:17
R space 20. That's what this is. And then again we have the simulation same
1:09:24
thing. Um and uh yeah then the the third one is
1:09:30
the blue g implementation or the author of this post and so now they've uh
1:09:38
released this implementation of previous algorithm this is on github under the
1:09:44
account fiser under the blueg account but the uh repository fiser 36p. So the
1:09:51
code is available for this. Um basically you have some make files and then this
1:09:56
uh read me here which tells you how to uh run this program
1:10:02
and yeah so that's and then you this is so this is their implementation
1:10:10
and this implementation produces uh result for 22 different points each
1:10:15
having 15 parameters and this is the simulation. So you see these sort of almost looks
1:10:22
like um so it's like these uh stochastic
1:10:29
events are forming these trails
1:10:34
and you know may look like blood vessel formation like bacterial colonies growing merging
1:10:41
into one another. It might look like um
1:10:47
some other diffusion limited process. Now it kind of looks like the
1:10:53
flow of liquid or some sort of
1:10:58
thicker viscous fluid. This these are all really interesting things and again it's very qualitative
1:11:04
because we we're not measuring the extent of these different structures or
1:11:10
characterizing them with any sort of sophisticated mathematical model. We're just simulating with these parameters
1:11:16
and seeing what the result is. So it gives some information they give some information about real time setup
1:11:24
diffusion and decay algorithm depositing things on the trail map and
1:11:29
then some reflections of the differences between the different variations of the
1:11:34
model. You have these color experiments uh velocity effects
1:11:43
uh playful interaction ideas mixing. So these are, you know, different versions of the elk. Play around with them to see
1:11:50
if they do interesting things. And so that's uh this is the interactive
1:11:57
fiserum repository which kind of shows some of the results and then some other experiments where
1:12:05
as this algorithm stands, you know, it it's workable. You can get it to work
1:12:11
and you can get it to do a lot of interesting things, but there's also a lot of for experimentation
1:12:17
and sort of teasing out the parameters and figuring out what works even better
1:12:23
or what produces new and novel results. So this is all very interesting
1:12:30
and again it's the sort of qualitative aspect of simulating life but I think it
1:12:37
has a place in informing you know what life is or how life might do things and
1:12:43
lifelike systems and it isn't um you know a reductionist sort of approach uh
1:12:52
it has the you know has all these different things of course we talk about mechanics I talk about fluid dynamics as
1:13:00
as part and parcel of like say cell biology or morphogenesis
1:13:05
and I think this underscores the point of that because you know to get things to look lifelike you need to have fluid
1:13:11
dynamics you need to have uh different types of mechanical as you know effects
1:13:17
you need to have interactions you need to have then of course the cells themselves and their own properties.
1:13:22
This kind of uh collapses all that down to a simple interactive simulation. But
1:13:29
you know there are all these different we we have say like we consider the
1:13:34
equations of fluid dynamics the equations of mechanics things like that for a reason because we need to be more
1:13:41
precise in when we backwards engineer some of this stuff and try to figure out
1:13:46
the mechanism. Although this is not um would say that there is a limit to how
1:13:52
much redu you know how we take the reductionist views. So here's some
1:13:58
additional resources and then hopefully this is and this is I think this has been very inspiring
1:14:06
for our group. So if you have any questions this is by Etien Jacob
1:14:12
um and you'll find this at uj.com fiserum Explanation.
