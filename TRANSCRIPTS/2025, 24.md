Hi, how are you? Good morning. Morning. No picture from you.    
0:05    
What do you mean? Oh, there you are. Okay. Okay. I just sent you an email a few minutes ago.    
0:11    
Okay. Sounds good. Okay. It's about vessel area. Oh, okay. Well, is there new action on    
0:19    
that front or there's a new participant? Okay.    
0:25    
We'll have to take a look at it after the meeting. He want He's building a robot.    
0:30    
Oh, okay. Was he inspired by the work we've been    
0:36    
publishing or Oh, yes. Okay, that's good. It was good to see    
0:42    
someone want to do that or something. Yeah, you might want to rope them in.    
0:48    
Yeah, I'll take a look.    
0:55    
Yeah. Hello, Morgan. You    
1:04    
never seen the real Morgan. That's the electrogan.    
1:10    
Yeah. Hello. Oh, hi. There we go. Yeah. Yeah. I'm back back in again.    
1:16    
All right. Just just getting getting uh Yeah. Gotta get my daughter ready for her summer    
1:22    
camp. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Susan. Hello.    
1:28    
Hi. Morning. Hi. So, how are things with you?    
1:35    
I I'll take an hour and visit with you guys. Yeah. Yeah, sure. That's great.    
1:42    
Take a break from it. Yeah. All right. So, yeah. Um,    
1:49    
yeah. Looks like we have Andre and Jratha. Hello.    
1:58    
Hello. Uh, are you hear me? Yeah. Yeah.    
2:06    
I just want to drop by because I recently get active on GitHub again.    
2:12    
Okay. In the reviving uh all the projects. Let's say    
2:18    
I hope you Yeah, that's great. Thank you. Yeah, welcome.    
2:24    
Uh Jay Dra. Hi. Hi. Yeah. Hi. After a long time, I'm again    
2:31    
uh joined this meeting. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, recently I I graduated. I    
2:40    
had I I was super busy for last few weeks and now I think I can join every    
2:48    
week maybe. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, you you've wanted to    
2:55    
you've been wanting to give an update on your uh Google summer of code work.    
3:01    
Yes, it is. Why don't we do that now? Okay. So uh I was working on this uh    
3:11    
like this data uh that is uh this paper connects development principle of brain    
3:18    
for CL and it had uh total eight different uh snapshots of the brain    
3:25    
connectors and uh uh what I tried to see    
3:30    
if we can create some discrete time temporal graph out of it and then uh    
3:35    
maybe run on some uh DTDG framework or models on this this data. So when I was    
3:44    
trying to see and uh like do some data analysis I found it has lot of things to    
3:50    
cover uh which I don't I didn't have much uh knowledge about uh and and these    
3:56    
things are I mean really cool so I found there is some data sets that is    
4:02    
available in open world uh in this website and uh it has    
4:09    
I mean it has some cool visualizations u some electrical and chemical uh I mean    
4:17    
uh these are the connections that was there. So what uh I downloaded these    
4:23    
data from uh here from open warm uh conneto toolbox and it has all these    
4:30    
data available uh somewhere here uh somewhere here. Yeah, these these are    
4:38    
total eight uh different excel sheet and in eight different excel sheet it has uh    
4:45    
these eight different uh like    
4:50    
uh snapshot of the data. So in these snapshot data like these are L1. In L1    
4:57    
they have four different snapshot and then L2 there it has uh one and L3 there    
5:03    
is another and L4 there is none and L4 uh then adult uh there it has seven and    
5:12    
eight and they have written uh the is here somewhere here. Yeah. So all the    
5:22    
the data set where it has come I mean L1 is at B the data and then L2 after five    
5:29    
5 hour and they have taken a snapshot of the connectors and its connections and    
5:35    
then uh data set 3 has at 8 hours and    
5:40    
then uh L1 uh data set four it is at the laral stage that is estimated to be at    
5:48    
16th hour and then data set two it is at the end of the learn first    
5:55    
stage that is at 23rd hour and then L3 27th hour uh it is like adult and then    
6:03    
young adult and that is at seven and data set 7 and that is at 45th uh 45    
6:11    
I uh so basically what I have done this week I just uh created Uh    
6:20    
I mean I started creating this I mean I downloaded those data at first and then    
6:27    
I tried to see uh what what are the connection it has. So data set one it    
6:33    
has uh this many connect connections 858 and then it has 146 presinaptic neurons.    
6:40    
These are unique uh number of preseptic neurons and 173 number of postsaptic    
6:46    
neurons. And one thing I have seen here as    
6:51    
uh I mean this for postric this increased a bit uh as we go to like    
7:00    
eth data set and the number of connections that is the number of ages. So you can see connection edge number of    
7:07    
ages that increase uh as we uh like go    
7:12    
from uh birth towards uh adult age as we have gone we have seen number of    
7:18    
connections that increase here from 858 to 2496    
7:24    
uh and uh so this is the datas that is available so these are the preaptic and    
7:31    
postaptic and then type electrical chemical. These these are the type of    
7:37    
connections electrical or chemical and then sinopsis how many connections    
7:43    
between these two preaptic neuron and postaptic neuron and these are the    
7:48    
number of connections. So uh it signifies the strength strength uh how    
7:54    
much strength it has. This is what I found. And then uh I    
8:00    
analyzed each each of the data uh like sign up uh the number of uh for each    
8:08    
data or each page uh like in data set one how many chemical or electrical data    
8:15    
that are available and the count range uh how many counts are there. In some of    
8:21    
them it has one, some of them it has nine, some of them it has eight like that and the mean signups per    
8:28    
connection. So as as you can see here uh so suppose here in this connection they    
8:34    
have three number of connection here they have nine number of connections here they have six number of connections    
8:40    
and most of them it has only one number of connection. So here I have shown the    
8:46    
average mean sinopsis uh per connection that is 1.63 1.83 like that. So here    
8:53    
also we can see uh at the start uh like during the birth    
9:00    
phase the mean sign of per connection that was 1.63 as we go towards uh adult    
9:07    
phase it is increasing so 1.63 to 1.83 then 2.2 to 02 and count also the range    
9:16    
that also increases and as we go to data set A it now it is 3.37 so the so as    
9:25    
we're going towards adult phase the number of sinopsis per connection that also increases that mean it trends    
9:34    
the connection and another thing I have seen is the chemical for chemical the    
9:40    
connection it is uh much more than the electrical connection and it was shown    
9:45    
here also in the uh paper also they have written somewhere    
9:53    
J are those connections from one cell to another in both directions or just one    
10:00    
direction uh I guess one direction    
10:05    
one direction I guess I guess so because presoptic neurons are I mean it is going from    
10:14    
pre-eneraptic to postaptic is it I'm not sure about that is it is it the case    
10:19    
preaptic to post I think somewhere in that data set they do have a distinction between pre and    
10:25    
post so you can actually get the orientation but I don't know exactly in this case what what the    
10:33    
I don't know how that's um stated yeah I have seen like here they have the    
10:40    
uh like arrow mark. So there from there I I I found maybe it is because it is    
10:47    
going from P to pos    
10:52    
it was as assumption I mean yeah so you'll get a lot of reciprocal    
10:58    
connections between cells they're going from one to the other and then one to the other and but you know this is    
11:06    
something that in development you're going to see changes in um but yeah I    
11:11    
don't you know when you get into the data set a little bit more maybe um    
11:16    
there are some interesting things you can do with those kind of directional connections and figuring out    
11:23    
like how they change. So okay I I didn't see any two-way arrows uh uh    
11:30    
in the those pictures. Yeah. Yeah. That is the thing. I also    
11:36    
didn't see much. Uh but it's like most it is one-sided. There might be if we    
11:43    
zoom more maybe we find. Oh yeah, there's a pair. Yeah, I see a pair there on the left.    
11:51    
Okay, right side here somewhere.    
11:57    
Is this AWC cell self have a synapse to itself?    
12:04    
Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They can synapse upon themselves.    
12:09    
They can. Okay. Yeah. I mean to think about it like you know cybernetics where you have feedback    
12:15    
loops and you have self regulation, you have    
12:21    
you know autoregulation, you have regulation between pairs of cells. Uh a    
12:27    
lot of articulation in this kind of network. So yeah.    
12:32    
So okay and yeah here I found one it is both the connection there that like from    
12:38    
as to a then a to here I found some    
12:44    
like both the way connection okay yeah    
12:50    
yeah this is the data    
12:55    
uh do these neurons have any distinguishing features other than uh    
13:00    
the uh lineage tree. Do they look different? Are they    
13:07    
chemically different? Uh uh    
13:14    
I mean uh these things are like chemically different. I I'm not    
13:21    
sure but I guess uh since they have different name probably they are like uh    
13:28    
they have different uh characteristics. Well, I thought the names came from the    
13:34    
lineage tree. Which names? The names of the cells.    
13:39    
Yes, the names of the cells. Oh, those are Yeah, those cells are neurons. So, the neurons don't come    
13:45    
directly from the lineage tree. That's the adult nomenclature.    
13:50    
But the this this is uh so awi those are the adults differentiated    
13:56    
neurons. And then those differentiated neurons come from the lineage tree and we have information on like where are    
14:03    
they coming from in the lineage tree. If you go to the interactive lineage tree which we talked about that that    
14:09    
information is yeah I found yeah and you have I found this website. Yeah in me.org    
14:17    
I found all these connections are there. So suppose if I write about this ADA so    
14:24    
it has all the connection that are available. So these are chemical synapses and these are gap junctions.    
14:31    
Gap junctions they're telling the electrical as gap junction probably uh    
14:36    
uh like where what we have written here the electrical type. So electrical type    
14:42    
is uh they showing it as a gap junction and we can like we can take any suppose    
14:48    
this one I'm taking this one and we can see what are    
14:56    
Which one is connecting to what? So, yeah. I guess I'm asking is do these    
15:01    
cells look different? They have different shapes.    
15:07    
Yeah. I mean, they're different shapes. Uh, you mean the morphology of the each cell?    
15:12    
Yeah, I think they're different shapes. I'm not really sure. You'd have to go to an atlas to see, but I think they get    
15:19    
Yeah, they're different shapes. They uh have And of course, they have the gap    
15:24    
junction connection. So they're not just spheres you know.    
15:29    
Okay. And uh then    
15:36    
like from paper I have taken these uh age hours when uh when this data set has    
15:44    
appeared so that I can create snapshots at different uh so like we can create    
15:50    
the DTDG that means discrete time temporal graph data set. So each uh snapshot will be    
15:57    
one graph and this is what I tried to see. So here so overall overall I have    
16:04    
seen the total number of unique neurons that are 225. So that will be my number    
16:10    
of nodes in the data set and in each node will will have connections and it    
16:17    
will be directed graph and uh for each capsule and uh the direction and the uh    
16:25    
age strength will be the number of connections it has or this one the    
16:31    
signups it has. So for this one it is one    
16:36    
for this one we will have three like that    
16:42    
and this is it. uh uh till now I have done this and now the thing I I'll do    
16:50    
I'll create a DTD uh I mean graph out of it and then I'll I'll see uh few few of    
16:59    
the recent method that are available and I'll try to model those    
17:08    
okay yeah so I mean in this field I'm pretty    
17:13    
new and understanding the is little difficult for me. Initially I was uh I    
17:20    
mean going to different websites and uh also I took help of chat GP as well.    
17:29    
Okay. So to be clear on the data sources, you    
17:34    
have the data sets from L1 to young adult and you have these sampling points    
17:42    
and then you have the neurons that are connected like pairs and you have the    
17:49    
reciprocal connections. So you have one to one, one to the other. Like this is    
17:55    
typical of conneto except you have time points in development where there's    
18:01    
synaptic information instead of just the the pair connection information and then    
18:08    
you're going to have this direct basically you can build directed graphs    
18:13    
from that and build an evolving graph essentially from L1 to    
18:19    
exactly yeah exactly that that is what uh I want    
18:26    
to do like create this graph and then try to see if there is any intermediate step we can predict something like that.    
18:34    
Yeah. Yeah. So yeah that and it's interesting in this paper they go through some analysis of the different    
18:42    
counts over time it like I I actually wrote a paper where I use the data set    
18:47    
as well uh where you know you do the counts over time and you get these fluctuations    
18:54    
and it's interesting but I mean it tells you a little bit about like what's happening with synapses at different    
18:59    
points different circuits. So you could take like a subset of the uh adult cells    
19:05    
and say these or I guess terminally differentiated cells and say that this    
19:11    
is what's happening in the conneto during laral development and there's there should be a lot of plasticity    
19:16    
there should be a lot of fluctuation between the synapses and you know they    
19:21    
they get pruned and they come back and you know depending on what's happening and this is only taken from one worm. So    
19:28    
sometimes worms will suffer things like starvation or they'll suffer uh resource    
19:33    
deprivation and they'll do things like go into developmental arrest or they'll    
19:39    
go through this dow stage where they have they have these neuroprotective    
19:44    
uh adaptations that they take on. So these are all things that kind of are interesting biologically.    
19:50    
Um but this this is like a nice temporal graph because you know you can get a    
19:56    
sense of like with the network how the network changes just you know what the    
20:03    
fluctuations are maybe find some interesting things with respect to some    
20:08    
of the circuits like some of the movement circuits. we can isolate that and say hey you know the movement circuit is changing in this way during    
20:14    
development and you know there are these synapses that are changing and we can also model    
20:21    
the synapses once we build the temporal graph to say okay this is maybe how it's    
20:26    
affecting behavior so yeah    
20:31    
and then the other thing is there these stable connections and then there these I know they have like a a typology of    
20:38    
connection so they have the stable connections which are usually things that persist across development. You have like the    
20:44    
developmental connections which are like you know in development you get special connections just to deal with what's    
20:51    
going on in laral development and then these like transient connections. So those would be interesting to break out    
20:57    
as well like you build a graph a series of graphs with just one set a series of    
21:02    
graphs with another set and so forth. So yeah, I think you have a good    
21:09    
baseline though here for like building these. So like you have the data, you have a method for getting it into Python    
21:16    
and playing with it and building the graph visualizations. Yeah.    
21:22    
Yeah. Okay.    
21:29    
So your plans for uh next next steps for that    
21:38    
Yeah. So as I told plan plan is to create this graph out of it and uh so    
21:45    
till now I found the number of nodes and the connections. So those things are    
21:51    
already available and the ages the age that means uh who is connected    
21:58    
connecting to whom and now I'll create a data data set that is temporal data set    
22:03    
and then I'll try to find uh through using some uh already existing uh I mean    
22:12    
temporal uh graph models and we'll try to model it through uh I mean if we can    
22:19    
find some some ex uh exciting pattern in between. Suppose in L4 stage there is no    
22:29    
uh data set that is available. So can we predict something in the L4 L4 stage uh    
22:36    
I mean what is the connection that that uh that that can be there. So that is    
22:42    
what I wanted to do. Okay. So you want to make like basically the visualizations    
22:48    
but also predictions to L4. So like maybe between developmental stages. Yeah.    
22:55    
Yeah. I think that's good. I'll Yeah. So all these things uh till this point    
23:02    
till data set six I'll create a visualization and see what are the uh I    
23:08    
mean how it looks like the connection looks like and then using these connections that are already available    
23:15    
can you predict something in between or intermediate steps uh that that is what    
23:21    
the goal is ja do you ever get connections between    
23:27    
cells that are far apart. Uh I didn't get    
23:35    
he knows that. Yeah. Well, I mean, yeah, that brings up another question which is can we like find the    
23:43    
uh developmental precursors to these adult neurons and then can we find    
23:50    
the positions from the da the developmental data that we have. So we have a developmental data set that has    
23:57    
the position like from cell tracking has the positions of the developmental cells    
24:02    
and then you can figure out where the neurons are. Actually you can figure out where the neurons are from like another    
24:07    
atlas too but this would be you know kind of thinking about where those    
24:13    
neurons are in the nervous system. Yeah. Oh okay. Okay. So 3D connection you're telling    
24:19    
Yeah. Some sort of 3D position. Yeah. So we don't we don't know at this    
24:24    
point. No, we don't know. In this data set there is uh we don't have that.    
24:30    
Okay. So those graphs do not reflect distance. Yeah. Huh. No.    
24:39    
I'm wondering if they're Oh, go ahead. Okay. So you'd have to get accumulate    
24:46    
the data of where each cell is and then calculate the distance for each of those pairs.    
24:54    
Uh yeah yeah yeah I mean if we have that the 3D uh like where it is and uh it's    
25:02    
3D coordinate then uh like uh getting the distance that is very easy.    
25:11    
Okay. I I guess when it when two cells synapse,    
25:16    
the question is, do they only synapse to local cells or do they reach out for    
25:23    
cells that are far away?    
25:28    
Okay. Andre, would you like to say something? Yeah, I just I remember then when I look    
25:36    
at theization of the Syrian um for example so and I noticed that a    
25:43    
lot of cells which are very very long and almost uh    
25:48    
that's muscular cells probably which uh very long and most like they connect    
25:57    
different parts like head of worm and the tail of worm almost it's like it's    
26:03    
not all of them but it's it's hard to guess all day. No, like not    
26:10    
so but like like not plain but some kind of like    
26:18    
cake when you press something just something like that. I mean I'm not sure.    
26:25    
Yeah, it's hard to generalize I think distance    
26:31    
from such such shapes. It's like it's probably    
26:37    
not if we somehow divide by morphological properties maybe it's like    
26:44    
only that makes sense because some of them large some of them compact    
26:50    
etc. No kind of three four different kind of shapes.    
26:55    
Okay. In other words the centrid of a cell may not have much meaning for cell    
27:01    
that's elongated. Yeah. Yeah.    
27:07    
Okay. Yeah. You have a lot of bilateral pairs,    
27:13    
too. So, you'd have to count like, you know, there'd be a longer distance, but it's like, well, it's a bilateral pair,    
27:20    
so there's a functional reason why. But, yeah, I mean, we if we could get distance data, it would be interesting.    
27:27    
Certainly, like if we could say these are head neurons, these are tail neurons. like what is going on there    
27:34    
those connections because that's a functional hypothesis that's like okay well something's going from head to tail    
27:40    
there's you know obviously some function to that so yeah we could    
27:47    
we could say things like that I mean I think the biggest thing though right now is just getting the model working like    
27:53    
getting it in place generating the visualizations and seeing if we can like    
27:58    
you know kind of make some pictures Bradley, maybe uh distance between cells    
28:05    
could be distance between their membranes rather than their centroidids.    
28:10    
Yeah. Yeah, we could do that. uh if if these uh data are available    
28:17    
somewhere I mean uh the like people who have uh collected this    
28:24    
data if they have taken while collecting maybe it was there otherwise I guess is    
28:31    
difficult right to get well there might be some uh conneto cell    
28:38    
tracking data we could also take it from the open browser. I'm not sure if those data are    
28:47    
like if we have a quantitative we should have it. I don't know somewhere. Um but    
28:52    
uh we can look into that to see where we can get those data. Okay.    
28:58    
Anyways, I think that's good. That's a good update. Jatha, thank you. Um so    
29:03    
yeah, keep on working on this. This is great. Yeah, I'm working on it. Yeah.    
29:09    
Yeah. Yeah, actually I mean I'm very new into    
29:14    
this this type of data and the terms uh like terms that are there. So to    
29:22    
understand those it was taking time. Yeah. But otherwise development is not that uh    
29:28    
difficult for me but understanding the data and how can I contribute there that    
29:34    
is uh that was taking time. Yeah. Um, Bradley, there's also the uh    
29:41    
question of whether or not the synapses are uh deter mosaic the way the cells    
29:49    
are. Okay. For example, if you take a left right pair    
29:54    
uh of cells that synapse each other, do they also synapse corresponding cells on    
30:01    
left and rights of the embryo panel? Yeah, I don't I don't know the answer to    
30:08    
that. In other words, is bilateral symmetry preserved or not?    
30:14    
Uh well, I think a lot of the bilaterally symmetric cells are synapse    
30:20    
each other because they have like a functional ask about their synapses to    
30:25    
other cells. Are they the same? Is the left right cell    
30:30    
the same? Uh I'm not sure. Yeah, we could find that out, I guess.    
30:37    
Yeah. So that that be that would indicate whether or not the synapsing is part of the mosaicism.    
30:45    
Yeah. We'll have to look at that. Yeah. Might    
30:51    
be an interesting question. All right.    
30:57    
Yeah. All right. Thank you, Jatha. It's good.    
31:03    
Um, I I see Hussein's here. Well, Hussein, thanks.    
31:09    
Hello. Nice to see you guys. Hi. You wanted to talk a little bit maybe about what you're doing these    
31:15    
days? Sure. Yeah. Few things. Um, yeah. Thanks, thanks so much for this. Uh, so    
31:20    
Dick and I, Dick and I have been working with a group in Italy with Sabino Sino    
31:25    
Longo on the uh on our Gflow peptide membrane product. Okay. Excuse me. So,    
31:32    
basically, uh, we are now in the pro we are in the process of applying for a    
31:37    
grant we're in the process for applying for a grant to potentially fund research um on    
31:44    
peptide membrane dynamics as it relates to the origin of life. Yeah, excuse me. Excuse me. Yeah. Um, I    
31:52    
don't have so much else to show and present right now. I can show some of the images from the report. I think it    
31:58    
might be okay. a statistical mechanical model for lipids first hypothesis.    
32:05    
Excuse me. We are drafting a bunch of papers and we're drafting a bunch of different things,    
32:13    
excuse me, excuse me, on simulations to determine how peptides uh the lipid    
32:19    
membrane to to to study and determine some of the    
32:24    
mechanisms underlying lipid uh formation. um the lipid membrane    
32:31    
formation particularly in the context of peptide rats and um with a hexagonal    
32:36    
grid model we can simulate the lipid membranes and peptides and how they evolve under very simple physical constraints and together with Sabino's    
32:44    
group over in Italy we are applying for some grants to get this together    
32:50    
that's basically all I have to share right now I can share some of the outputs from our just very simple    
32:56    
simulations yeah basically We we're trying to simulate affinity denom    
33:04    
excuse me here. So we we introduce these hexagonal    
33:09    
grids. All right. So basically basically um when we're talking about the origin of life, how did cells come about? How    
33:16    
did life come about? We answer questions of nucleic acid replication. And I think there's been a lot of evidence showing    
33:21    
that the peptide interactions they themselves preceded the genetics. So    
33:28    
stepside alpha helyses in particular we can use them to we can embed them in membranes based off the hydrophobic thickness and create stable micro    
33:35    
domains that influence membrane behavior and we can simulate those with these    
33:40    
hexagonal grids these hexagonal like uh we call it chevron chevron I think it's    
33:46    
called chevron. So this is this is a chevron pattern when things are just arranged in a V like that. Yeah.    
33:54    
We can uh We can simulate these hexagonal grid lice structures in a simplified lattice system in which these    
34:01    
um these hexag these hexagons uh excuse me the these hexagons form a    
34:08    
grid that show how lipids or peptide units    
34:13    
bond with one another. Okay. Yeah. And we're getting some we're we're    
34:19    
writing some papers and dropping some things together to hopefully apply for a small scale grants. I think that's what    
34:24    
I mentioned to you in Slack. Let me just That's what I have right there. Um,    
34:31    
what about those? Did you have those visualizations or I saw those graphs that you were showing?    
34:37    
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Some random Yeah.    
34:43    
simulate binding affinity over time. So, okay. So, each of these visualizations represent Let me let me share my screen    
34:49    
again. Yeah. These visualizations represent how peptides might move in space and bind    
34:57    
over time. Now, this is all completely random because we just wanted to show that we could we could move them all together, but uh yeah, we the model so    
35:07    
the the hex the hexagonal lattice excuse me the hexagonal lattice    
35:14    
is meant to simulate the peptide dynamics themselves. Yeah. Okay.    
35:20    
We want to simulate how they uh how the uh they can interact with the lipids and    
35:25    
drive early membrane structuring and clustering the vesicle dynamics uh the vesical dynamics themselves. So this is    
35:32    
all completely random but it does show that we can get them to move over time and obey very simple rules and    
35:37    
mechanisms when say affinity turns off or affinity turns on or sim similar simple things. Yeah.    
35:44    
So cool stuff. I think it's great. It looks great. Yeah. Looking    
35:49    
forward to seeing the outcomes of that. You guys ever played Katon? That's what it reminds me of.    
35:55    
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Settlers of Katon. It's a board game. These hexagon board game units. That's    
36:01    
That's always what I think of. Settlers of Katon. Yeah. Chinese checkers works too.    
36:08    
I guess Chinese checkers is that's a that's a hex, right? The Chinese checkers, right? Yeah, I think so. It's been a long time    
36:14    
since I played it. Yeah. Yeah. There it is. So it looks like the the center is a hexagon, but it's actually six triangles together. So    
36:21    
that would be a hexagon. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. So yeah. Um and the uh the chevron    
36:28    
chevron pattern what I found when I looked this up here chevron is the name of the pattern. So    
36:37    
where does the chevron pattern fit into that? I didn't notice. Um Oh, right. So the chevron dick had a    
36:43    
better image. Let me show the better image that I have. Um    
36:48    
the chevron pattern. Well, the the chevron just the the stripes in a line like that. That's the    
36:54    
chevron pattern. It's not um specific to this. Yeah. Excuse me.    
37:02    
Excuse me. Right. So this is supposed to be like early pattern formation or something    
37:07    
like that. So the other Okay. We we are just showing that we can move them right now in Python. That's the only that's the    
37:13    
important thing right now. Okay. then we can code any sort of simulation rules or methods or mechanisms for the research    
37:19    
itself and um you know we've been basically devouring tons of papers like    
37:24    
the glutton that we are and um we want and consum consuming a lot of these you    
37:31    
like the the there's a demer paper that dick had given excuse me excuse me I'm I'm like jumping    
37:38    
from many different things from one thing to another the demer like uh for example like we can start with this one    
37:43    
right Um this paper uh from 1991 looks like it was from 1991. Okay. Um    
37:50    
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of like in this one for example. Yeah.    
37:56    
It looks like this one they're proposing the very specific hypothesis of how    
38:03    
excuse me excuse me how the uh how poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons phah would    
38:11    
absorb light in the near UV and blue wavelengths and are candidates for primitive pigments. I think that's    
38:18    
that's one example of how the origin of cellular life may have come about and    
38:23    
the papers themselves are pretty interesting too or the figures are pretty interesting too excuse me um say    
38:30    
how you can go from because they describe the hex hex hexodine perian mixture in this itself you know    
38:38    
I thought that was interesting you want to talk more about this one the zemer the the demer paper excuse me    
38:43    
yeah I've been looking into these they're called They're abbreviated P a    
38:49    
right. Uh    
38:54    
cool hydrocarbons. Now these things are usually quite poisonous.    
39:00    
Uh but one thing which Demer didn't emphasize is that because they're    
39:07    
hydrophobic, they concentrate in the membranes and therefore the membranes can actually    
39:13    
protect the rest of the cell from any pH phahes on the outside. Uh and meteorites    
39:20    
are full of them. Uh so they uh they're probably in there. I I've also been    
39:26    
finding that the phes can actually make the membrane swell a little bit and    
39:32    
increase the permeability. Uh because one of the problems uh that    
39:40    
early life didn't have to solve is that small molecules will go in and out of a    
39:45    
vesicle. Right. Okay. Yeah. I think I think you know turning turning the hypothesis and    
39:52    
seeing you know just just opening it up for for questioning through these sorts    
39:58    
of simulations that's a very good way of starting okay here we go I found the image that I was looking for the uh of    
40:05    
the triads the tri triads the tri triads so not just hex hexagons hexagons excuse    
40:12    
me not just not just hexagons um I see I grew up in a house where we speak like four different languages    
40:18    
And all my family is from different countries. So my pronunciations of things will change within their own sentences. So with English words,    
40:28    
but we can we can arrange like my family is from UK. We also dig back to India and we speak like different languages    
40:35    
and even accents between my American pronunciations and my family's British pronunciations. They just get mixed up    
40:40    
all the time. So um excuse me, but you see you guys see these walls. This is this is the the chevron structure. the    
40:47    
chevron pattern. The chevron pattern is just like kind of like like stripes arranged together.    
40:54    
But we can form walls. We can form walls with these things. Yep. And uh that this    
40:59    
is what it would look like. Um if you wanted to see that it would be peptide    
41:04    
the peptide pattern. Um like so I this would be what we would be    
41:11    
looking for. Um this this would be this would be one of one of the one of the types of patterns that we'd be testing    
41:16    
how this could come about in some ways. I think Dick had showed me one written one of his manuscripts I think. So like    
41:23    
uh and because you showed it was like made with like Matt Lab, right? Yeah.    
41:29    
Okay. But yeah, cool stuff. Cool stuff. That's what we are. Yeah.    
41:34    
Are there are there any other tilings you could use other than the hexagon?    
41:40    
Okay. Um well in theory obviously yes but um see    
41:48    
the the question the the the the choice of using the hexagon matching the structure of the lipid peptide membrane    
41:57    
um versus other ones say like even a like even like like a square or a uh    
42:02    
like a pentagon pentagon um I think in many ways you'd ask    
42:07    
yourself what sort of physical constraints on the system you would have to impose And like for for the for the PH for    
42:14    
example, they'd be typically, you know, shown as derivatives from like hexa hexodine say. So if we wanted to get    
42:22    
more more fine-tuned try even like a pentagon and what sort    
42:29    
of geometric formations might come up with that one like you you definitely could, but not    
42:35    
you'd have to combine a five and sevensided    
42:41    
um geometry in order to get a tiling.    
42:47    
Yeah, Susan, we're we're making a simple approximation. Okay. And it's also molecules, so    
42:56    
they're more rigid. Yeah. Stability hypothesis for those sorts of    
43:02    
a lipid is represented by one hexagon. The uh alpha helix of an embedded    
43:09    
peptide is represented by the three and that's having to do with the the    
43:16    
ratio is approximately 1 three uh for the widths of the these molecules in the    
43:24    
membrane. So we're we're doing a crude approximation tool problem of having    
43:31    
heptagons and pentagons and uh in there and we're assuming a planer membrane.    
43:38    
Okay. Okay. So it's a rough approximation. Yeah. Yeah. I Yeah, you're modeling it.    
43:45    
It's okay. It's okay. I just thought I'd ask.    
43:51    
Yeah. Yeah. I mean um you know with with um Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.    
43:59    
So cool. Cool stuff. Cool stuff. Yeah. Susan to put it another way. Mosting lattice    
44:05    
uh simulations are done on regular grids and uh we suspect the membrane uh is    
44:12    
acting somewhat like an ising lattice and giving uh some phase transitions.    
44:19    
Okay. No. Yes. Yes. It could be made more    
44:24    
complicated by by having more an irregular grid.    
44:31    
But then every every part of the grid would have to be simulated separately.    
44:39    
Hex hex hexagonal structures just give so much so much of that strong balance    
44:45    
between a lot of uniformity. all the pieces just arrange them with hexagons that can connect and even intersect, you    
44:52    
know, but a lot of uh flexibility even with those things, too. So, yeah.    
44:58    
Yeah, they're easier to work with. I know this. A lot less programming. I just went through a bunch of modeling    
45:07    
using hexagons. Yes. Yeah. They're easier to work with and they're supposed to be more stable.    
45:13    
Yeah. On that on that level, of course. So cool, cool stuff. Um, yeah. Yeah,    
45:19    
this is all exciting and you know, anything that can be stimulated people through the programming, you know, we we    
45:26    
question. So, okay.    
45:31    
All right. Well, thank you Hussein for that update.    
45:36    
Looking forward to seeing it move along. Uh, yeah. Yeah. Sorry, just just for context. So,    
45:42    
we were applying for we're applying for a grant, the space exploration grant program through a I think it was called    
45:48    
a Chiwi. That's what it was called. Isn't that the name for it? It was It's CHI    
45:54    
WI Foundation for Space Exploration Science Grids    
45:59    
like like this one. So, that's the context behind all this.    
46:05    
We're trying to get money. Trying to get money. Trying to get money. No, it isn't.    
46:11    
We're trying to get money so we can do groundbreaking research. Yeah. Yeah. So we can eat.    
46:19    
That doesn't hurts. Okay. But um Yeah. Cool. Cool stuff. Cool stuff. Um    
46:25    
Okay. Okay. All right. Well, thank you. Yeah. So, I'm going to present something here    
46:31    
for the last 10 minutes. Looks like Leith is having connection issues. I was going to ask him if he had something,    
46:38    
but we can catch up later on that. And he's given a nice set of updates in our Friday meetings. So, we've got that um    
46:47    
now, but let me move on to this uh article. This was posted in the Slack by Jesse Parent.    
46:54    
And uh this is from the Wolf community. So, this is kind of like their community site. And of course the wolf community,    
47:01    
they're all interested in uh cellular automa and sort of these evolutionary    
47:08    
cellular automa using cellular automa for everything and evolving them in    
47:14    
these arrays. So what they're doing here is they're simulating    
47:19    
well they call it biological evolution in the wolf evolution model. So, Wolver    
47:24    
has an evolution model that's based on cellular automa and these propagating patterns that come down like this. And    
47:32    
the question is, what shapes can organisms have? And so you know this is    
47:37    
an idea where you want to get an account of all possible shapes an organism can    
47:43    
have and then you know understand sort of the constraints to those shapes and    
47:49    
then understand sort of the p number of pathways evolution could have taken to    
47:55    
form shapes to form body plans and to form phenotypes. So this is um    
48:02    
so this is basically the cellular automa and because the cellular automa are    
48:08    
computationally irreducible it's hard to predict the next step in a cellular automa. It's very much the    
48:15    
stochastic component to their evolution. So you can see that like basically these    
48:20    
cellular automa are propagating according to these different parameter values and you know they're using this    
48:27    
as a method they're using this as an analog for the generation of phenotypes    
48:33    
in biological evolution. So um you know they say due to its    
48:39    
computational irreducibility predicting the behavior of cellular automa is a difficult almost impossible    
48:46    
task. However, can we introduce the behavior of a cellular automaton? Can we    
48:51    
induce the behavior of a cellular automaton? More specifically, can we control its shape? In order to answer    
48:58    
these questions, an experiment was conducted to evolve various cellular automa configurations to a specific    
49:05    
target shape, considering cellular automa boundaries as its fitness function.    
49:11    
I' I'd add to this that there have been a lot of attempts at this to sort of get this people's uh to get your arms around    
49:19    
sort of the development and evolution of shape. A number of groups have done    
49:24    
papers where they've used solo automa to do this and they always kind of come up with this method where they're kind of    
49:30    
imposing some sort of template on the shape and    
49:36    
maybe that's not how nature does that. So that's just the dotted line is    
49:42    
yeah this is sort of the dotted line. this is sort of the boundary of this region. So yeah, it's you know they're    
49:50    
they're always trying to do this sort of impose these sort of top down mechanisms    
49:55    
for controlling shape you know although you generate within that boundary um and    
50:02    
you know there's no evidence that nature really does that. So that's kind of the caveat here. So what they do here is    
50:09    
they talk about analyzing different configurations. So uh they they generate these configurations. You see this here    
50:16    
this is the density plot of the cellular automa. This is the output step and this    
50:21    
is like the the width of it. And then they do this frequency plot where they analyze uh the frequency of different    
50:29    
phenotypes and their rank in terms of abundance. Bradley I can think of a case which    
50:35    
needs investigation. Okay. If you uh if you grow up a chick,    
50:43    
it has a very rigid shell. Yeah. And therefore, the shell may constrain    
50:49    
the shape. Yeah. And the question is, is that correct? In    
50:55    
other words, if you could grow a chicken without a shell, would you get a chicken?    
51:00    
Right. Okay. not obvious but it's an example of    
51:07    
a rigid constraint right yeah I think there are some early    
51:13    
experiments in sea elegance where they took the sea elegance embryo and they    
51:18    
split it up into two parts so they split the anterior end and the posterior end and they kind of let them develop    
51:25    
separately and they developed these weird shapes so they didn't develop according to the sort of really    
51:30    
yeah yeah I don't know it's like the cell lineage kind of developed independent ly and there they developing    
51:37    
these barbell shapes and things like that. So it wasn't really constrained by    
51:42    
well you know um you know some people would say it's maybe the boundary of the space maybe it's some sort of signaling    
51:49    
that goes on between cells so it could be chemical signaling or electrical signaling that kind of holds that shape    
51:55    
together. Interesting. We did yeah we did an experiment on axles where we constrained the axe level    
52:03    
uh to the developing ax level to be between two glass plates. Okay. And we we ended up with uh uh what's    
52:12    
called I think it's called curtosis. In other words, the back was arched. So    
52:19    
the head and the tail were opposite each other looking out rather than rather than straight.    
52:25    
Yeah. Uh but that's an example of an artificial constraint.    
52:32    
Um our skull our skulls uh grow within constraints. Um yes. If the constraints    
52:41    
on a skull um and an infant are constrained because the soft spots the    
52:50    
fontels are connected wrongly. you'll get an oddshaped skull.    
52:57    
Yeah. So, so there's that's a mechanical system also intention.    
53:05    
Yeah. I mean there there are these examples of like kind of boundary conditions and    
53:11    
then there's like kind of this and it's you know you have local things and then you have this global sort of constraint.    
53:17    
So it's hard to say which things are responsible if they're all responsible. But anyways, this is I think an    
53:24    
interesting exercise in sort of analyzing sort of the evolution of shapes using a    
53:30    
cellular atom. So if you generated a bunch of possible shapes, what basically    
53:36    
shows up and what is their frequency? So you know, you might get things that are more common than others. There's this    
53:42    
idea of carcinization in evolution where um if you look at a fogyny of of    
53:48    
different uh types of invertebrates, they always tend towards this crab phenotype. So that has like this if you    
53:55    
if you know what crabs are, it always has that same phenotype where it has like the center shell and then the    
54:01    
appendages and that happens. It's like that's evolved convergently across    
54:08    
uh marine invertebrates. So you get this idea that, you know, there are certain    
54:14    
uh phenotypes that recur, there are certain phenotypes that are common. And then why is that? Is it because they're    
54:20    
constrained by some sort of body plan or is it because that's just kind of a more efficient shape? And so in this case,    
54:26    
you get a more efficient shape where you get this, you know, some of the possible shapes are limited with certain    
54:33    
configurations. There's a lack of shape variety. Configurations of two colors are not used in the evolution process.    
54:39    
So that kind of um constrain this further. So this is adapting to shape.    
54:46    
So this is the sort of the take-home message here. So some successful shapes for a lifetime up to 50 steps which is    
54:53    
very short are these types of shapes. So you have this he long hexagon. You have    
55:00    
this diamond shape. You have this triangular shape. You have this sort of    
55:05    
uh hexagon on top of another hexagon. Sort of like a club shape. And then you    
55:11    
get these kind of uh trihexagon shapes that kind of look almost like an    
55:17    
organism with a tail. And um so this is basically uh you know these aren't some    
55:24    
of these have achieved a high fitness level but not all of them. These are kind of like the most common outputs.    
55:30    
Other shapes were considered but they had a lower fitness rate so they were discarded. One of these is this sort of    
55:36    
it almost looks like a clamshell or a hexagonal clamshell. What is the definition of fitness in    
55:42    
this case? Um I don't know what their definition of they define it here.    
55:50    
Um pro let's see uh there's some sort of fit. Okay. Oh the cellular automa    
55:56    
boundary is the fitness function. So it's this boundary that's the fitness function and it's kind of    
56:02    
Yeah. Yeah. Basically. Okay. Does that that is that from uh like like from Conways from Conway's game of life?    
56:09    
Uh what do you mean the the method or the the fitness the fitness function?    
56:15    
Um I don't think so. I think Conway's game of life is on a free uh free grid.    
56:21    
So there are no boundaries that they they worry about. It's just Yeah. Um okay. So then this this is the    
56:28    
evolution of the cellular automa was made using the adaptive cellular automation fun automaton function. This    
56:35    
function implements a biological evolution algorithm with some parameters to control the evolution process. They    
56:42    
include the cellular automa rule configuration, the mutation rule, the fitness function    
56:49    
as we discussed, and the number of mutations made. So they're mutating these shapes. They're imposing this    
56:54    
fitness function. They have this rule. So the system evolves according to some rule. And this goes back to the cellular    
57:02    
automter rules. So it's basically how each cell interacts with its neighbors.    
57:07    
And they list these here. To select the most successful case, this    
57:13    
adaptive cellular automaton function was executed multiple times using the parallel table resource. With these    
57:20    
results, it is possible to select the most fit and understand the overall behavior of the solo automa    
57:25    
configuration in relation to the fitness shape. So they go through about a    
57:31    
hundred evolutions. They analyze these each for each shape and number of states    
57:37    
and they show these graphs that show kind of the output for um these these    
57:44    
tenants for the six vertex shape. So this is the six vertex shape changing its shape over time and you get these    
57:53    
slight variations in it. Um and then so yeah the fitness function is shown in    
58:00    
blue. So it's this constraint which is kind of like the top of a hexagon and then the boundary of the cellular    
58:06    
automaton is shown in yellow. So there's some variation of the edge. It overlaps    
58:11    
the boundary. Sometimes it gets within the boundary and then that's kind of like how it's assess the fitness is    
58:17    
assessed that way. So things that exceed the boundary are lower have a lower fitness than things that kind of follow    
58:22    
the and so um and so we can visualize this    
58:28    
by plotting the cellular automa at the end of each evolution. So you can see that there are a lot of sort of    
58:34    
convergent shapes here um for different parameter values and then you know you    
58:41    
can also uh visualize the evolution breakthroughs and that's defined as when the mutations lead to a greater fitness    
58:47    
value for each case and then this is the evolution of the best case on the    
58:53    
simulation example. So you see the evolution here where these things are kind of assembling here and making    
58:59    
breakthroughs as they're evolving. So sometimes they make changes in shape that are unique that are innovations and    
59:06    
sometimes they kind of follow the same pattern. Okay. Uh Bradley is Wolf from himself a    
59:13    
co-author on this uh this is just using this environment. So no he's not but you know he's kind of    
59:20    
supervises a lot of the work on this. So um one way to visualize this function is    
59:27    
by plotting a graph of its evolution. So we can plot out this floyny and we can show that the green nodes with higher    
59:34    
fitness sort of predominate down towards the bottom of the fogyny.    
59:39    
So that's right there. And so that's um pretty much that paper. I just wanted to    
59:45    
go over that to show some examples of cellular automa evolution    
59:51    
and shape formation.    
59:58    
Cool stuff. Cool stuff. Um, yeah. Excuse me. Uh, cool stuff. I I appreciate um I    
1:00:06    
appreciate the scouting through different shape possibilities. I hadn't    
1:00:12    
considered that so much before. I figured when studying the origin of life, studying uh studying similar    
1:00:18    
questions down there, you kind of have to uh limit yourself to a particular shape, a particular structure from the    
1:00:24    
get-go. So, that's really fascinating, especially with cells. The biggest thing that always comes to my mind, especially    
1:00:29    
back when I used to do neuroscience research on say like neuronal cells and neuron cells was the minimum limit for    
1:00:36    
how how small how small they could particularly be given the complexity of    
1:00:41    
what they contain. Especially in particular, you know, at some point you're bounded by all of the um all the    
1:00:48    
all the stuff all the things inside a cell about how small they can truly be. So yeah, interesting talk. All right.    
1:00:58    
All right. So, I think that's it for today. Um, thank you for attending Andre. Uh, yeah, I I have a question. Uh, so I    
1:01:07    
I try to update the tracker database which seems to be uh like neglected for some time. Yeah,    
1:01:14    
at least what was suggested on the GitHub and the one issue is that there are    
1:01:21    
database it by itself. I get lost or I should somebody should contact previous    
1:01:29    
researcher and maybe they have that database. So my question did somebody    
1:01:34    
try to contact them or just I have to do that myself or uh it's already contacted    
1:01:41    
and nobody knows or whatever. I'm not sure. Yeah, you could open an issue on GitHub but there also    
1:01:48    
no it's already exists it is okay. Uh well maybe I can get in touch with some    
1:01:53    
of the people involved in that and see this is the movement tracking database or the movement database. Okay. Uh why    
1:02:00    
don't you send me a message in Slack if you can and we'll talk about that    
1:02:05    
offline. All right. Thank you for attending. See    
1:02:10    
you next week.
