Hello. Morning. Morning. Great. Great to see you.    
0:08    
Good to see you, too. Looks like Lewis and Paul are here. So,    
0:15    
um hi. And Bar.    
0:25    
All right. So um I guess we can start if Leoith wants to give an update. I know    
0:30    
he was upset that he met missed uh Friday's meeting but    
0:36    
yeah so I actually had some uh visa processing things going on with me so I    
0:41    
wasn't able to join so sorry about that and uh yeah I had a meeting with uh D    
0:47    
where we discussed about the know the visualization parts of like how hypograph can be done and also he had    
0:54    
shown us some you know work where uh uh how the cells have in exponentially    
1:00    
growing in a log scale where like cell types. So we had an interesting discussion and uh I am and in the like    
1:10    
the GO project I'm actually working on the visualization tool where uh I can uh    
1:16    
use the hyper    
1:26    
looks like he dropped out. moved away. There he is.    
1:34    
Sorry, I got cut off for some reason. Yeah. So, I was working on the    
1:39    
visualization part of it. So, I'm halfway done. So, probably by this week, I'll probably able to show that uh know    
1:47    
how you mean the the way the neural networks learns and the embeddings of    
1:52    
the neural networks the way it got learned their hybrid just and we'll be able to visualize them.    
1:58    
Okay. So I'll probably show that. So that's from my side. All right. And I'm actively looking into works    
2:05    
where you know uh where people have implemented C elegance and hyperraphs and so that's uh the updates from my    
2:12    
side. All right. Uh so you the visualizations uh the CL so people were doing    
2:18    
hyperraphs and C elegance or what was that last part?    
2:24    
Yeah. uh so I was thinking of reading the literature where you know people ever have tried about using CL    
2:30    
hypographs on clans data sets so that it could be a good benchmark so I was looking into the research too so    
2:36    
probably if I can get to understand more in detail like how the research has been working if we can you know build the    
2:43    
entire pipeline and you know we can say that this is our standalone approach so yeah    
2:50    
yeah I think um I don't think anyone's really used hyperraphs I mean Maybe. But yeah, I know a lot of people used    
2:56    
to capture the literature. Yeah, I know people have done things with like graphs in the conneto.    
3:04    
So that's I mean and then the conneto of course as well characterized with regular graphs. Um yeah, you might try    
3:12    
looking in the literature for different uh the way people have approached    
3:18    
you know the the conneto and you know look at how you can improve upon that. So    
3:25    
especially with respect to like function and how that could be part of the hyperraph.    
3:33    
Yeah, Bradley I Yeah. Uh I consider this completing the sea    
3:39    
elegance uh tree. Okay. Yeah. Okay. You know it's uh it's about it's    
3:47    
kind of strange that nobody did it before, right? Sorry if I'm saying    
3:52    
they they've had the data but they haven't done it right. Did you want to update us on the    
3:59    
uh what else is there to update the maybe the cential cells or the hyperraph? What uh sounds like Leith and    
4:07    
Dick had a meeting about the hyperraphs?    
4:12    
Uh yeah, I can give you something which I just discovered this morning. Okay. Uh    
4:18    
I've been concerned about that curve that I've got which shows increasing intelligence over geological time.    
4:25    
Right. Okay. And uh uh I read the uh the book    
4:32    
uh the law I forgot exactly the name laws or something book by ien    
4:38    
uh and uh I've gone through it and he    
4:44    
he's concerned about population growth cons considerably.    
4:49    
It's a 1975 book, right? And it's it's written in the uh how    
4:54    
shall I say in the modus vendi of the club of Rome people. Oh, right. Yeah.    
5:00    
In other words, somehow we're going to solve this problem and there isn't a word in the book about the pernicious    
5:06    
sides of trying to callull people. Right. Okay. You know, somehow we gota we got    
5:13    
to solve it. And they had four billion people on Earth at the time. Now we've got eight billion. And people are    
5:19    
panicking. Yeah. And they've forgotten the uh the old UN    
5:25    
projections that we would peak at 10 billion and then decline. Right. Okay. You know that's very inconvenient    
5:32    
if you want to call people. Okay. I'm not familiar with the IEN book. What    
5:37    
is it? Laws of uh let me get it just a second. Oh, okay.    
5:43    
Okay. I Yeah. Manfred Ian and Winkler. Laws of the game. The principles of nature    
5:49    
governance. Yeah. Yeah. The book was published in 75 in German and later translated to English    
5:57    
and Italian from an exponential before it blows up. Okay, they're they're very    
6:04    
close if you try to fit the data. Uh so I've got I've got to go ahead and    
6:10    
try to fit fit the data I've got which is very limited to a hyperbolic curve    
6:16    
and see if I can predict the singularity. Okay. The hyperbolic in other words the    
6:22    
hyperbolic function has a singularity and I don't know if it's the same as the Kirkwell singularity.    
6:30    
Okay. Yeah. Okay. But they use the same word. Uh uh    
6:35    
at any rate, I was think trying to think this through and I just came across something this morning    
6:41    
which is a group called uh nuclear genomics. Nuclear genomics it claims that they can    
6:50    
choose choose your embryo before it's born for intelligence. Okay.    
6:57    
I don't know if that's correct or not. Okay. So what is intelligence?    
7:02    
What is intelligence? I IQ. I don't know. I don't know how you test    
7:08    
a pre how you test an embryo for IQ.    
7:13    
Yeah, but someone could have an IQ and have abs and trip over their own feet    
7:20    
all the time. Oh, sure. Intelligence. Yeah, we have we have a name for that.    
7:26    
That's uh uh Oh, shoot. What is it? Uh absent-minded professor.    
7:32    
Well, yeah, that's one of them. I don't know if that's the professors on the    
7:40    
other are there's a name for it. I think it's from the French. Uh, somebody who is very intelligent in one small aspect    
7:46    
of their life and they're stupid otherwise. Idiot soant.    
7:52    
Idiot soant. There we are. Oh, okay. Yes. Yes. Okay. I mean, there there are people like that. Okay. So, I was    
7:59    
figuring Okay. What if you did that for a number of generations?    
8:04    
Would you make people that are smarter than the artificial intelligence?    
8:09    
Yeah. Okay. So, this is another way of getting to very high intelligence at least a    
8:18    
plausible path to it other other than making smarter and smarter artificial    
8:24    
intelligence. Okay. All you do is you you keep doing this. Every generation you select for    
8:30    
the most intelligent embryos. Okay. I don't know if it'll work. I    
8:35    
haven't tried. I can't I can't say that the generation    
8:41    
out of me is particularly intelligent, but okay.    
8:46    
But then I didn't get to choose. So, so at any rate, it's it's it's an    
8:53    
interesting way of how should I say manipulating genetics so that we get    
9:00    
more intelligence. Now, whether intell more intelligence means more brain cells or more connections between them, etc.,    
9:08    
we don't know yet. Okay. Now, more asberers, more asberers. Right.    
9:15    
Yeah. Right. Right. Yes. I guess it's been proven if you make neurody divergent.    
9:21    
If you make two asberers, you get more asberers.    
9:26    
Two really intelligent people have a whole pile of asberers children.    
9:32    
Yeah. Anyway, of course, those people be may be the very ones that are replaced by AI. So,    
9:41    
you know, I have a grandson uh who who's interested in going into plumbing    
9:47    
because AI will not replace plumbing. Well, you never know.    
9:53    
At least we get an artificial intelligence robot that can figure out plumbing.    
10:01    
Okay. Whereas things like doctors, they're easy to replace. they're all being replaced by uh the current AI. So    
10:10    
uh as a given that's my field, I actually think a lot of the capabilities of AI    
10:16    
are very overhyped or overblown. Oh yeah, but that's because AI is in its    
10:22    
infancy. It just made its breakthrough. Well, the the underlying architecture of    
10:28    
LLMs, the transformer means that AI like will never tr have a true understanding    
10:34    
of of of what it's doing. I mean, there's attempts to to link it to to like neurosyolic methods. There's    
10:41    
attempts with like retrieval augmented generation, but like even with rag, it's still going to hallucinate references.    
10:47    
So like is something like that going to be reliable for making medical diagnosis    
10:53    
unless we change the the approach of of a IML? The answer is no. I mean    
10:59    
essentially transformer is a universal function approximator. So so    
11:05    
you know I think I think a lot of that's over. Yeah. I mean I I'm aware of the limitations of the current AI. For    
11:11    
example, I uh I was using Grock and I did a    
11:17    
search on Grock and it came up with this flat statement that something wasn't true and I pointed out it was wrong.    
11:25    
Okay, I quoted the source that the source that proves it was wrong. So,    
11:30    
what it did is said it will modify its database based on what I told it. And    
11:36    
that's extremely dangerous because I could have told it something false.    
11:42    
Okay. And that's what I think that's one direction that AI has to be protected against and that is people who are    
11:49    
pernitious and put in false data because AI will accept it.    
11:56    
Okay. So that's an example of limitation of current AI also. Uh you know it also    
12:03    
sometimes makes up references you can't find on the internet. uh if you want if you ask it for references just makes    
12:10    
them up. And this is supposedly because the function of AI is not to inform you,    
12:16    
is to please you. Oh no.    
12:23    
I can think of a whole pile of ways that could go wrong. Yes. But at any rate, uh you know, so    
12:31    
we're at the very beginning. I mean, I grew up with AI being a total flop.    
12:36    
Yeah, there were a lot of people working on it, but the computers just weren't fast enough to do anything significant.    
12:43    
So, it was regarded as a flop for decades and then all of a sudden uh    
12:49    
these uh deep learning things came out and they're much better. I mean, I you I    
12:55    
use I I use it every day uh for reference finding, but with the caveat    
13:01    
that every reference I'm given, I have to check. I think given this nuclear    
13:08    
genomics group and the idea that you could compound it over generations at    
13:14    
any var and leith and I are uh working on a paper that we're calling brainy AI    
13:21    
okay and the ide the idea of the paper is to is to try to figure out what is it about    
13:28    
the human brain that's different from the construction of AI and whether we    
13:33    
can improve AI based on that okay uh we don't we don't have anything solid yet    
13:41    
uh the uh we however we think we can do a comparison    
13:46    
uh I know none of us have supercomputers but uh they're pretty fast the ones    
13:53    
we've got right if we modify the AI we ask the same question and does it do better okay so    
13:59    
so we think we have an objective way to test whether or not we're getting anywhere    
14:05    
Okay. So, uh we kind of have to now collect properties of neurons    
14:12    
uh such as how many connections they have, whether it's electrical or chemical, uh how many cells there are    
14:19    
and we have to guess at how many different kinds of neurons there are because what one of the things is AI    
14:25    
uses all neurons the same as far as we can tell. Yeah.    
14:31    
Are we right about that? uh for what all neurons are all neurons that are simulated by AI or    
14:39    
used by AI that are fundamentally the same except for the weights scientist    
14:44    
uh usually yeah I mean you have things like spiking neural networks but that's not usually used in    
14:50    
a lot of the commercial AI I mean there there are different ways you can do it I mean most of the ways    
14:55    
are just kind of like they're units and then the weights are the important thing you take the weight matrix and    
15:01    
use that spiking neural networks generate spike you know like simulated spikes and that's kind of what you know    
15:09    
in simulations of C elegance as well although they don't produce true action potentials but you can play with those    
15:15    
and you can actually get or heterogeneous outputs but that's you know it's kind of hard to    
15:21    
to work they're harder to work with in terms of okay so var and leith at least note that    
15:29    
and see what literature you can find for ask Bradley. Yeah. Yeah.    
15:36    
Okay. Uh also I I do want to mention I have a I have a background in like a heavy    
15:41    
background in a IML in the field. So um to to answer your question I mean    
15:49    
activation functions can can change but the main way in which they're going to vary is the architecture of the layers.    
15:55    
That's where most of the advent of neural nets you know are. Yeah. We just got a paper a few days ago    
16:01    
on waves between neurons. Uh so that whole groups of neurons can    
16:08    
affect another group uh by a wave of some sort goes through them. And uh    
16:14    
that's a possibility. you know uh that book by ien says    
16:22    
memory has got to be in the connections whereas    
16:28    
if there's ever a way of making memory to be in the RNA or the DNA uh that    
16:34    
might be an alternative okay so uh you know there are all sorts    
16:40    
of things to consider here while we're thrashing about trying to find a a what we call bring the AI.    
16:47    
Well, yeah, I don't know. We'll see. Okay. Yeah. So, it's fun, but the this stuff I this    
16:56    
company's doing suggests a way of getting it getting brain getting a    
17:03    
smarter human brain which just might exceed AI,    
17:08    
but you got to breed for it and you have to select for it. You have to do by deliberate selection. Yeah.    
17:15    
And and probably over many generations. I mean the the time scale on uh that    
17:21    
graph I showed uh is the the tick marks are at 100 million    
17:28    
years. Yeah. Yeah. It is    
17:34    
over Okay. How do you keep the curve going? So we may be we may be very dumb compared to 10 generations from now.    
17:42    
Yeah. So uh I guess it's also a source of humility.    
17:48    
Yeah. Well, okay. Okay.    
17:54    
So, yeah, Vers is working with you on this. Uh could you introduce yourself in machine learning and right now    
18:01    
working on neural speech decoding from the neural activity and uh yeah I love    
18:07    
speech decoding and yeah I'm interested in C elegance school. So yeah and I I    
18:14    
got to know about this by Lalit. Lalit is my friend here in    
18:22    
the interested learn and recently I started working with Nick on brainy AI.    
18:30    
Okay, sounds good. Yeah, let me let me show you that curve.    
18:36    
Yeah, for because Jess I don't think you see it. Uh, let's see. I've got to get back    
18:43    
to here and    
18:49    
uh start screen sharing through there. Share. Okay. Now in word.    
18:59    
Okay. Can you see this? Yeah. Yeah. Notice the scale. It's log 10 of    
19:06    
the number of nerves. And these are for different organisms. And the uh the age    
19:12    
is given in hundreds of millions of years. Yeah. Wow.    
19:17    
And it's just coming up as an exponential. This is a this is an exponential fit to    
19:22    
the data. Okay. Now I made that exponential fit using Mathematica. So I    
19:28    
don't know what the criteria are for the fit. You have to dig into Mathematica to find out. But this this curve is going up and    
19:36    
there's no it's not plateauing. Well, so the log 10 is number of neurons    
19:42    
or nerves. Nerves. It should be neurons. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I should re    
19:49    
Yeah. So I mean, you know, it's like kind of like you have one example of like big brains or like these largely    
19:57    
expanded brains and that's mammals and probably most uh vertebra. Yeah. Like in vertebrates,    
20:04    
you have larger breeds and say like in No, in invertebrates are not on this. These are uh these are all uh regulating    
20:13    
embryos. They're all regulating. Well, yeah. So they're just basically    
20:20    
if you make this curve for mosaic embryos, uh it's flat. Oh yeah, I saw that one. Yeah.    
20:27    
So that was just the regulating. Yeah, this is just regulating.    
20:33    
So the I figured the key to doing this extrapolating the curve requires    
20:39    
understanding embryogenesis. But I thought that meant constructing a uh an    
20:45    
embryo artificial embryo. So you see this reaction, there's two reactions to    
20:51    
this. Wouldn't it be great to have a kid that's smarter than you? Uh    
20:56    
or no. No, that would make me nauseous.    
21:02    
Yeah. Okay. So, it's it's a it's a curious thing. And they're actually claiming    
21:08    
they're now selecting for intelligence. Okay. Okay. But they didn't think through if    
21:15    
they have customers over many generations then what?    
21:21    
Because if if it works, you see by selecting for intelligence, we don't know if you're selecting for number. We    
21:28    
don't know which property of the brain you're selecting for. Right. Right. Okay. Whereas what we're trying to do is    
21:35    
guess that uh for brainy AI.    
21:40    
Okay. This this because you're just doing selecting for intelligence. You don't have to know that.    
21:47    
Yeah. Okay. And for what I can tell for all the work    
21:53    
on the brain, we really don't understand how the neurons work.    
21:58    
Well, how they Yeah. I mean, how they put together intelligence rather. Yeah. How they put together things like    
22:04    
intelligence, vision, etc. Uh, you know, it's So, we're hunting around for clues.    
22:10    
Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, it's kind of fun. It's now this is    
22:18    
the opposite of what Elon Musk warns us all about that artificial intelligence    
22:23    
may replace all our jobs.    
22:28    
Yeah. Well, fine. Okay. Uh let let him see if he get artificial intelligence to    
22:35    
replace a sink tap, for example. Yeah.    
22:40    
You know, so this is the story here.    
22:46    
Uh I don't know. Well, you're in you're in it. Yeah. There's also YouTube by    
22:52    
this guy Khan Siddi Sedeki claiming that he's selecting for indulgence.    
23:00    
Get that just a second. Uh let's see just    
23:06    
Paul has the story Paul has the article up here. So    
23:12    
okay maybe can here let me get this uh first    
23:20    
uh I just realized I was muted. I I uh I    
23:28    
was trying to say I had the article pulled up. I can stop sharing if necessary.    
23:35    
Well, you took that big banner out. So, we'll use your version. No. Yeah, that that's    
23:43    
I was asking if there's a Although I was muted. Is there a certain part you wanted me to pull up?    
23:48    
Oh, no. No, the whole thing. Okay. If you can turn it into a PDF and send it to me, that would be great.    
23:55    
I can do that. Okay. I'll put my email address shortly. Just a second. Okay. Uh    
24:04    
Okay, here it is. So, uh any rate, uh    
24:10    
it's kind it's kind of fun. Uh I don't know if it'll make us smarter AI, but uh    
24:17    
we may we may find a path to it. Yeah,    
24:24    
I think by starting with the dumb AI and seeing if we can make it smarter, one one approach.    
24:34    
I don't know there's three of you there. Uh, any of you know how to make a dumb    
24:39    
AI that fits into a laptop.    
24:51    
Well, yeah, thanks for that update. That was good. Uh, look forward to seeing what you guys get, you know, do in that    
24:57    
area. So, by by the way, um, my answer is yes to    
25:03    
that question, but it depends on what you're you're trying to do. Oh yeah, play tic-tac-toe or something.    
25:09    
I don't know. I' I've literally trained LLMs on my laptop. So, Oh yeah. Okay. Well, oh then with the    
25:17    
code in the laptop. No internet connection. Yes, correct.    
25:23    
Okay. Because we're worried about how much energy it takes AI uh to use up.    
25:30    
I mean, so I trained like a small parameter LLM. It took it took a a hot    
25:35    
minute. It took like 10 hours in training. So, okay. I'm slow learner.    
25:42    
Here's the here's the thing. Even even if you do like rent an A10 cloud instance, right? Um generally these LLMs    
25:51    
are so large that they they literally train for for days if not weeks even when they have access to hundreds of    
25:58    
GPUs quite literally. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, any rate, I'm not    
26:03    
suggesting any of us buy a supercomput, but yeah.    
26:10    
At any rate, uh, so that's what we're doing. We're trying to predict the future and ignore all the naysayers.    
26:18    
Oh, okay. That sounds interesting. Ambitious.    
26:23    
Yeah. Morgan, put a chat a link in the chat. What is that, Morgan?    
26:32    
This is um Compel 3D's um summer summer workshop is still going.    
26:40    
Yeah, it's a I attended that last year. It was It's    
26:46    
interesting that that type of modeling.    
26:52    
It's not not what I wanted to do, but it was interesting.    
26:57    
Right. What what do they what do they cover this year in the workshop? Is it like    
27:03    
the same every year or is it different? Oh, it's the same every year. Yeah. Yeah. He's got a very um you know    
27:11    
um it's it's a very comprehensive overview of of the kind of different kinds of    
27:20    
computitional modeling that are that are possible, you know. Yeah. like uh you know certainly I    
27:28    
caught some of the kind of you know traditional    
27:34    
um lib roadrunner kind of metabolic flux    
27:39    
analysis that you know like you can find you can you    
27:44    
can find other courses that do that right but like but you know because they cover he really tries to cover    
27:52    
everything that is biologically relevant um for somebody    
27:57    
who's who cares about kind of virtual tissue modeling. Um yeah, it just covers    
28:04    
the whole the whole range. Yeah. And they've been doing some really interesting things like in the last few    
28:10    
I think after post pandemic they've been doing like a lot of interesting stuff with modeling    
28:16    
tissues and and bringing all the tools together. Yeah. Yeah. his um glim glim print is    
28:25    
his imological um seminar seminar series on th    
28:32    
Thursdays. I think it's Thursday. Okay. I I I don't know what the imprint is an    
28:39    
acronym for, but the I is immunology. Yeah, just those things. Yes. Um    
28:46    
Okay, Bradley, let let me make an analogy. We started DVORM because it was    
28:51    
obvious that open worm needed to understand embryology,    
28:56    
right? Okay. And I think the same thing is true about AI. AI needs we need to improve AI    
29:05    
beyond its current primitive state. We've got to understand embryology.    
29:11    
Right. Okay. uh and uh my reading of the literature    
29:17    
so far is that in terms of uh embryology of the brain that's extremely primitive,    
29:24    
right? Yeah. There are a lot of people trying to to incorporate elements of that, but it's kind of like uh what are    
29:31    
the you know, it's kind of like they'll they'll use a lot of analogies from psy developmental psychology and they don't    
29:38    
do it very well. Yeah, I mean if if you look at AI and the simulated neurons that it uses,    
29:46    
as far as I understand, they're very similar to the first model of a neuron    
29:52    
which is 75 years old, right? Am I wrong about that? Well, what do you mean by 75 years old?    
30:00    
The first modeling of neurons was done 75 years ago. Okay. Yeah. Oh, a 75 year old model.    
30:07    
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I mean. Yeah. Well, yeah. Well, it's And that's what's used in AI,    
30:14    
right? Well, it's it's an extremely abstracted version of    
30:19    
Oh, yes. Yeah. Yes. Of course. The first model and and and language models are actually    
30:26    
kind of using an updated form of that, right? Yeah. I mean, people Yeah.    
30:31    
approach it in different ways. Yeah. Well, just that Yeah. just there are some differences in the transformer    
30:37    
architecture, right? But yeah, I mean it's again like there    
30:44    
like you know you're if you add detail to the model, it's like what do you really need to add to make things uh    
30:52    
maybe more efficient or more um you know maybe understand context. So    
30:58    
you have to really kind of define what you want in your model to to have as an    
31:03    
output to say okay this is what we need to add from the brain. I mean it just    
31:09    
doesn't automatically happen that if you mimic biology that you get    
31:14    
Yeah. Yeah. I mean the brain is got it's got these waves.    
31:20    
I always wonder what the waves doing. Uh maybe maybe they're involved in    
31:26    
intelligence. I don't know. uh the uh there's all sorts of chemical    
31:32    
things going on in the brain. I mean your morning coffee is an example.    
31:41    
Okay. So uh you know what does all this mean and and does it help in improving    
31:50    
the intelligence of AI?    
31:57    
Maybe we should maybe we should give AI caffeine. I don't know.    
32:03    
Well, you could do like Yeah, in neuroscience they use caffeine in in some experiments as like a you know they    
32:10    
use different concentrations of the chemical. So it's like you could you could have like a model where the    
32:16    
neurons are sensitive to some virtual chemical and I mean they did they've done these kind of experiments in like    
32:23    
agent modeling and and artificial life where you give like you'll have a maybe    
32:29    
like some sort of network where you have cells and then you give them like a concentration of a chemical and they    
32:35    
behave a little bit differently. Could have like you know an activation function change or you know a difference    
32:41    
in the way that the outputs operate or something like that. I mean, you know,    
32:47    
then you're getting into like applying a life to AI and I know there are people    
32:52    
working on that aspect of it like doing things with um evolutionary programming    
32:59    
or you know different types of representations of well one hot area of    
33:04    
course is reservoir networks. Um, you know, you have a bunch of    
33:10    
neurons that are in this pool and they're connected randomly and then you    
33:15    
train the the network and it produces like a patterned output because you know    
33:20    
it's trained over you know it basically associates units get associated with one    
33:27    
another and it outputs something. It's very a very interesting and trendy area,    
33:33    
but it's like it's very hard to understand like what's happening inside the black box. But my point is there is    
33:40    
that you can use a lot of biological metaphors to sort of get to,    
33:46    
you know, something better than we have now. But it's hard to kind of know what that looks like. And,    
33:53    
you know, people try these ideas and they get these ambiguous results and Yeah. Okay. I got I got this triggered a    
34:02    
question. You're familiar with computer simulations of murders of birds using    
34:09    
voids? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Voids. Yeah. Okay. Has anyone    
34:15    
uh created such a simulation in which their voids act like the birds that Alf    
34:21    
Alfred Hitchcock made a movie of? No, I don't think so. But you know, I    
34:27    
mean, and then we could have a real murder of    
34:33    
birds. Yeah, I know that. Well, I know Tom Portigese was working on some void    
34:39    
simulations that had like where the birds could like see in front of them as    
34:44    
well, you know, because the original void simulations were basically where you had these simple rules that every    
34:51    
boy would follow in parallel and then it would produce these emergent behaviors.    
34:57    
But what if you could like see things in front of you? each boy had differential information that    
35:05    
you know so I don't know I mean like your answer to your question is probably no but I mean you know there ways you    
35:11    
could probably implement something like that there we go we should write a paper on the real murderous boys    
35:24    
looks like Hussein's joined us well Hussein did you have any updates for us.    
35:31    
Hi. Hi. Uh, no, not right now. Okay.    
35:39    
Any other Oh, go ahead, Susan. Do you have an update? Yeah, I have an update. Um, I just asked    
35:45    
uh Dr. Sharief if I could uh get some optical clearance tomography images of    
35:52    
salamander. And he said, "Yes, as long as I got all    
35:58    
the permissions, like I have to make sure that I have insurance for his lab. I have to have    
36:05    
the right permission for the salamander eggs, blah blah blah. I have to do all the paperwork." But he said that I could    
36:12    
come into his lab and use his equipment if I could figure out how to make it work. So,    
36:19    
new adventures. This reminds me of the animal care committee that insisted that our exodles had toys and that we keep    
36:26    
them dry. Yeah. Yeah. Well, in my case, I'm    
36:35    
they're going to say, "Well, where did you get the salamanders?" And I'm going to say, "From Kijiji."    
36:42    
That's That's pretty That's pretty funny. I've seen I've seen people keep them as pets, but salamanders and the and the exodals    
36:50    
Yeah. And uh they've shown me they've shown me their toys. They show me what they play with. They're pretty pretty pretty pretty fun creatures.    
37:00    
Oh well. Yeah, they do. They do play with things sort of. They're very slow moving.    
37:08    
That's what we need. Zebra fish. A fast breeding regulating embryo. You can try    
37:15    
to select for intelligence. Zebra make a zebra fish that's smarter than a    
37:21    
person for yeah they're I mean the the zebra the    
37:27    
zebra fish's uh navigational capacity    
37:32    
based off of their proximity to objects and their ability to detect those things in a in a closed aquarium.    
37:40    
That's one thing you know they they often compare that to the human capacity for that too. So there's that.    
37:47    
I don't like don't stick my head in the in the aquarium. Sorry.    
37:54    
At least when I when I study zebra fish, when we looked, for example, for the autistic phenotype, how it's expressed    
37:59    
in the zebra fish, we'd observe how they would prefer to remain stuck in one corner of the uh in one corner of the    
38:06    
tank and observe their movements compared to that of the other one. So,    
38:12    
okay. Yeah. Yeah. As for the the embryo development of the zebra fish, um it was    
38:18    
it was interesting. I think I remember back in like 2017, back in 2018, um that's when a lot of the labs at the NIH    
38:25    
were able to produce very stunning images of how the embryo had been developing for the zebra fish, too,    
38:31    
especially getting the the correct um the correct genes knocked down to to    
38:37    
light them up. Yeah. Yeah. Well,    
38:42    
we as I said, you know, if we had that in    
38:48    
intelligence test on lower regulating animals, maybe we could uh    
38:55    
test without doing it on humans. Um, also guppies, they they reproduce    
39:02    
fast. That's true. That's true. Yeah.    
39:09    
Yeah. I could give an Yeah, I could give an update on the um the    
39:17    
peptide project I've been working on with Dick and Sabino's group over in Italy. Okay. Yeah.    
39:22    
Yeah. Yeah, remember we had show we had shown images um of these lattice    
39:27    
structures these hexonal hexogonal um these hexogal like lattice lattice    
39:34    
excuse me essentially um writing papers and answering questions on the    
39:43    
formation of the lipid membrane    
39:49    
as well as the uh the origin of life on um and uh some very deep statistical and    
39:57    
mechanical questions uh from like say okay excuse me building on a lot of    
40:03    
early ideas from I get Winkler okay framing them yeah okay so you guys are    
40:10    
familiar I I get and winkler had the had the book it's like laws of uh    
40:16    
yeah we just talked about that book cool yeah it should get in my mailbox pretty soon hopefully He lost the game.    
40:22    
How the principles of nature govern and I'm going to be sending it to Dick and hopefully the Canada Post doesn't doesn't lose    
40:30    
I found uh my daughter found a source where I could get the book online but    
40:37    
it's the online copy is defective. It has some pages duplicated, some pages    
40:42    
missing. Okay. It was sloppily digitized in other words. That's unfortunate.    
40:49    
Yeah. Uh but I read what was there so excuse me. So um so anyways, Dick Savino    
40:57    
and the the colleagues over in Italy and I have been uh talking pretty thoroughly    
41:04    
on the origin of life stochastic versus deterministic origins taking the ideas from the Iron Wingsler book laws of the    
41:11    
game and framing them in more so in terms of the modern stoastic physics whether or how Homocyian and the    
41:17    
selection could arise from like the fluctuations the breakdown of a law law    
41:23    
the breakdown of the law of large numbers. Okay. Yeah. Um you know we talked about the fish ladder toy model    
41:30    
with demer paper right a more recent one. Yeah. And how we    
41:36    
could uh model the small system world for a non-extensive high variance excuse    
41:43    
me. So basically the when you're modeling membrane dynamics and the peptide clustering you need to account for a lot of different factors and one    
41:49    
of those is the non what we would call the the distributions of the fat tailed    
41:55    
fluctuation behavior especially in the very very early vesicle like environments. You want to make sure    
42:01    
you're modeling and simulating those correctly and accurately through the science itself. So, we've been we've been reading a lot of papers. Some some    
42:08    
pretty damn recent like the fish ladder model that Dick had published in 2023 and others dating back to like like the    
42:14    
60s with like thermodynamics and similar ones. Yeah. The fish ladder model. Are you guys    
42:20    
familiar with that? Do we did we ever talk about the fish? Yeah. Just give a brief review of that.    
42:28    
Excuse me. And I promise it's not like some climbing gate for fish to escape    
42:34    
the aquariums. The fish ladder is the fish ladder is a toy model that you can use to um Excuse me. Okay. Okay. Excuse    
42:42    
me. So basically um there's this idea of this uh of of a catchment area where the    
42:48    
vesicles and other components sort of come together in um in in a lake. Is    
42:56    
that correct? Am I getting that right? It's okay. a thermodynamic equilibrium when you have a large number of small    
43:02    
systems, one of them would reach the threshold for life. Okay? And this is what you call a ladder like like    
43:08    
climbing up to it. That that's what it is, right? We call the fish toy. Okay. The fish the fish ladder. The fish    
43:13    
ladder toy model. So basically what what's the plausible null model    
43:18    
that you can use to test the other hypothesis for the origin of life? Um and um yeah. Yeah. It's Darwinian. It's    
43:26    
Darwinian. Yeah, I guess so. No, don't not throw any until you have competition    
43:32    
and selection. Okay. Okay. Well, thank you. Thanks. Thanks.    
43:39    
Like that's that's the uh big step uh where everybody wait throws up their    
43:45    
hands and say and there was life. So yeah, fish ladder is like where the    
43:51    
fish go up upstream and they go up this structure that where they just climb up    
43:56    
into these different Yeah. It's based on a simple notion and that is    
44:02    
in a it's a a fish ladder is basically a a set of small pools that are higher and    
44:09    
higher as you go up uh the uh uh whatever land is available to get to a    
44:16    
to a source where a stream is coming. Right. Yeah. Okay. And the idea is that at each point    
44:23    
there's a probability of the fish going up and there's a probability that it ends up going down.    
44:30    
So you can ask given those probabilities, what's the probability of a fish ever getting up the whole ladder?    
44:36    
Yeah. Yeah. And you know it is funny because a fish ladder    
44:43    
get upstream and get ups. So this is that fish ladder. Yeah. See if the fish gets up then    
44:54    
to s succeed in getting all the way up are the ones that spawn.    
45:01    
So each step is like an energy barrier you go up eventually some of the fish will get up    
45:07    
to the top of the stream. Yeah. Into the spawning area. Yeah. At least    
45:13    
given enough uh vesicles at some point one of those vesicles    
45:19    
might reach the threshold for life    
45:26    
only a fluctuation. So so anyways okay so that would be the    
45:37    
model part of the project. Um, so we we talked about the Ian Winkler like the    
45:43    
law laws of the game that introduced this uh this once and for all like    
45:49    
principle. That was that was what it was, right? The once and for all principle,    
45:57    
right? The once and for all game. It's like this like a birth the birth and death process on the 8 by8 board.    
46:04    
We have a graph of statistical distributions of the pieces and you see how they move and you can see how when    
46:10    
you start with like an equal number of like pieces for different players the distributions would would widen and    
46:16    
become biodal. So one player would win if they're competing over something.    
46:22    
Yeah. So do you have a visualization of that or Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Share your screen.    
46:31    
Absolutely. It's like I hate I hate comparisons to to chess. I    
46:37    
think chess is just absolutely overrated, but like it's like it's like chess.    
46:45    
Well, there are a lot of games that are like that. Um, let me see if I can find that.    
46:52    
Yeah, this book is kind of weird. It's It's similar in a sense. I don't have Sorry, I don't have the book yet. That's the problem.    
46:59    
I don't know. It should be in the mail sometime this week. All right. I don't know what to look at. So, it's an 8 by8 board or an 8 by8    
47:07    
grid. There's some analogy between their work and Wolram's    
47:14    
huge work on uh uh what was it? The new science.    
47:19    
Oh, yeah. The cellular automa. Yeah. It's somewhat similar to that except that this is stochastic whereas Wolf    
47:27    
from is deterministic. Okay. I just uh I just Googled this one. Yeah.    
47:33    
Go ahead. Yeah. Sorry. It's not It's not like Nim. It's not    
47:39    
Nim. It's not Nim. But if you had a game you were playing in which um    
47:45    
Excuse me. If you had if you had a game in which two players controlled like different different pieces or different    
47:50    
different sets of pieces. At one point there's this g there's there's a version    
47:57    
of this this beat game called Once and for all, excuse me,    
48:03    
in which you you need to get all of your opponent's values to your values by flipping them. Okay. At some point at    
48:10    
some I think it's it's like Oll. So it's like Oll, isn't it? Yeah. Okay. You guys you guys know Oll.    
48:16    
Yeah. Yeah, that's the one where it's like so so you place pieces and when you uh when you    
48:21    
surround your opponent, you flip the ball to your color. Okay. Yeah.    
48:29    
Um I think so laws of the game it's called in excuse me excuse me. So, so the gist the    
48:36    
gist the gist behind that for what we are talking about here is that    
48:42    
uh oh hold on is this the book it's only part of it yeah I think the book is    
48:48    
online it's only part that's that's fine that's fine how how does a biodal distribution emerge over    
48:54    
time when you have some some game that you can play by shifting your opponent's    
49:00    
colors okay like at some point the pieces most of them some of All of them    
49:06    
would fluctuate back and forth between two colors or even other colors like red or blue or black or white or something    
49:11    
like that. Yeah. And whatever biodal distribution you you you would observe um selection dynamics in a game board    
49:18    
like system. Okay. I think it's it's also it's also interesting to see how    
49:23    
the large scale birth and death processes would you know this this would this would align this would basically    
49:29    
align with the peptide raft simulations. Yeah. Okay. So, Fish Ladder, the like these    
49:37    
these once and for all. Once and for all game. I think it's Is that the name of the game? Once and for all. Is that it? Who    
49:45    
Who was Winkler? Who was Winkler? I don't know. Winkler. I don't know either. Wa. Ruth. Okay. Cool. Cool.    
49:53    
Cool. Look. It's raining. Cool. Cool.    
50:00    
Nice. Nice. Oh, they're playing they're playing the game. They got it.    
50:05    
Yeah, looks like Yeah, they're trying to Well, the image you saw, it kind of    
50:11    
looks like they're trying to model DNA or RNA evolution. Is that correct?    
50:17    
So, it looks like um    
50:23    
so I don't know. This is Ollo, isn't it? It    
50:28    
looks like Ollo. They got the black and whites and you know I can't see your Oh. Oh, you can't see. I thought I was    
50:34    
showing my screen. You were, but not the not the not the image that you were talking.    
50:39    
Um, okay. I think they're on a different tab. What's What's the difference between Oll and Go?    
50:46    
What is Oh, well, those are two different games. Aello and Go are two different games. So, what do you mean what's the difference? Oh, okay.    
50:52    
So, go is go is Okay. Okay. Okay. So, I mean, yeah. Like the the the mechanic    
51:00    
the mechanics are different. Yeah. Um    
51:06    
I think are they wait no no way. Go and Okay. Go is way more complicated. Yeah.    
51:13    
Oh okay. Oll is like something I played in fourth grade when I was Yeah.    
51:19    
And it's like Okay. Hi guys. This has been fine. I need to get going to another meeting right now.    
51:24    
Okay. All right. Yeah. Excit exciting stuff. Exciting stuff. Um, and like I said before, I'm    
51:30    
really glad it's um it's these these things like like these very simple    
51:35    
simplistic games like Othell or perhaps go. And I'm really glad it's not it's    
51:41    
not chess. I think chess is hella overrated as a model of it's it's not it's not chess is    
51:48    
chess chess is stupid. Chess makes chess isn't about being smart. It's just about being good at chess. So,    
51:55    
okay. That's that's my that's my hot take. Everyone everyone thinks strategy and game theory is all like chess.    
52:02    
Nothing is like chess. Nothing in the real world is like chess except a battlefield because that's what    
52:08    
it's modeled after. You always see it in the movies and TV shows like the that the the smart    
52:14    
characters that'll be playing chess. I'm like what what are you doing? Why do you play as chess? Chess has nothing to do    
52:19    
with anything in life. Okay, that's my that's my rant. But thank you. Thanks so much. Um,    
52:24    
oh, no problem. Yeah, that's great. Exciting stuff. I'm just reading papers and absorbing them into my bloodstream    
52:30    
um to understand all the material and things. Um, Dick and I Dick and I Dick    
52:36    
Sabino and I meet every other week. Uh, so we're meeting bi-weekly. Sabino and    
52:41    
his group, they have their they have their obligations as well, too. So, we're just communicating and making sure we're all on the same page with things.    
52:47    
Yep. That's cool. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.    
52:53    
Thanks. Yeah. So, yeah, thanks for the thumbs up. And we had a couple of things    
52:58    
in the chat here. Looks like uh uh Jess says, "I will be at the Auglab    
53:04    
Summit at MIT later this year." ALAB being um different types. It's a lab    
53:11    
that he's interested in there. I should have some means to share some related work from orthogonal divor. So, there's    
53:18    
a way to overlap or have something that would fit. Let me know. Yeah. So yeah, I don't think I'll be working    
53:24    
directly with augmentation lab, but they're sort of related to some of the groups that I'm doing stuff with. Oh,    
53:30    
you will be Morgan in person. Finally, a meeting in person.    
53:36    
That's fantastic. Yes. Plug into those things on his head.    
53:41    
Yeah, right. Um, I was already making kind of a JPro social event around    
53:47    
around the uh lab, so that's really cool. Um, I might have a few other folks. I    
53:53    
mean, there's a bunch of stuff happening there. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so it's it's a    
53:58    
it's augmentation lab is is a kind of a    
54:04    
I don't know how to describe it. You can you can find about them online, but there they're I thought it was just    
54:09    
going to be like directly you know, um,    
54:15    
like like let's physically like kind of transhumanist, let's physically enhance our our body in a direct sense, but    
54:21    
there actually much more much much more broad than that. There's artistic stuff and and some cognitive stuff and and a    
54:26    
lot of a lot of interesting things going on there. Um, so I guess Morgan and I will be there, but I should have a means    
54:33    
to present like I'm going to have like a few things to present. Like I got some new stuff in Jerro stuff, but also like    
54:38    
if anybody here like kind of wants I could do like a small like hey check out    
54:44    
Diva Worm and this too like like I don't know if it be like a lot of poster space or something but just be able to promote    
54:50    
a few things that we're doing here if anybody is looking for like an outlet in that kind of a space. Um it should be    
54:57    
exciting to do and and and now will hopefully be a picture bor and I that we can share uh here next time.    
55:04    
Yeah, the physical meetups. We haven't done that in a while, but you know. Oh, yeah. That's great. Thank you. Um,    
55:11    
yeah. I don't know. Paul, did you have anything you wanted to add or?    
55:17    
Uh, I've got uh nothing at the moment. Uh, quick question. So, there's also Friday meetings.    
55:22    
Uh, well, we have different meetings for different groups. So the Friday meeting is our open source meeting and it's at a    
55:30    
different link and then we have our Saturday meetings for um actually we do talk a lot about AI in    
55:37    
that meeting and that's also at a different link. Um if you're interested in those meetings you can join. There's    
55:43    
a different Slack to join. I can give you the link to that and yeah that'd be great. I'm I'm figuring    
55:49    
out how I should contribute and I've also got my own research ideas. So, just trying to get myself oriented to the    
55:56    
project. Yeah, we might. Yeah, you actually because you're interested in AI, you    
56:01    
know, we might Saturday meetings might be really useful or you could, you know, uh actually I think develop some    
56:08    
research there. So, well, yeah, I'll be in touch about that. Yeah. All right. Thank you.    
56:14    
This one's sort of like the bofocus meeting project based.    
56:21    
All right. Well, I think that's all for today. Um, thanks for attending and uh,    
56:27    
see you next week. Good luck with everyone's different projects. All right, take care everybody.    
56:34    
Take care. Bye. Take care. Bye. Okay. Now, I wanted to talk about    
56:39    
something I hadn't gotten to in our regular meeting. And uh Dick asked a question last week about Evodo    
56:47    
and this is the evolution of development and the origins of evalu.    
56:53    
So I got some papers here that are very interesting in that regard.    
56:59    
So from a theoretical perspective, uh Evo Divo is this approach that kind of    
57:06    
came out of a number of findings that were happening in the late 70s and    
57:11    
early 80s. So as people started to do molecular biology on developmental    
57:17    
systems, people started to discover uh different experimental findings about    
57:24    
the expression of different types of genes in the body plan. what was known    
57:29    
at the time as the body and other types of findings occurring plasticity    
57:37    
and uh more importantly that evolutionary relationship. So they were finding homologous    
57:43    
genes and gene sequences that influence development and by homologous I mean in    
57:49    
different taxa that are related by a common ancestor. So there was some    
57:55    
similarity a function similarity of structure and then putting that all    
58:02    
together we get evil. Now it's worth noting that there had    
58:08    
always been a tension between sort of Darwinian evolution or theory of evolution and    
58:16    
development. So notably the German embryologists of the 19th century were very slow to take    
58:24    
up a lot of the ideas of Charles Darwin. Some of that was because they, you know,    
58:29    
they were working in German and Charles Darwin was working in English. The other    
58:34    
part of that was that conceptually didn't really fit into what they were    
58:40    
doing. So they were very slow to sort of accept evolution as being voluntary.    
58:47    
Um and then you had other people in uh the history of in the 20th century who    
58:54    
um are like Wington who argued that there were missing pieces in natural    
59:01    
selection and the theory especially when the uh neocynthesis was formed in the    
59:07    
40s and 50s. And so there was always this tension and then of course in the 70s and 80s we had these findings and    
59:14    
then it brings us to the sort of the theoretical synthesis that would result.    
59:21    
Um and so this is evo and of course some people argue that evode isn't really a theory. It doesn't    
59:28    
operate in the same way that you know it's it's not necessarily as predictive as we'd like. um it's largely a    
59:36    
collection of findings and then those findings have implications for evolution. But in terms of being fully    
59:43    
integrated with um you know some of the ways in which we think about uh natural    
59:52    
selection namely that they're populations and then we have population    
59:58    
genetics to describe the population dynamics of different genes. that's not    
1:00:04    
as prominent in Egypt. In any case, this is an article on this is from evolution,    
1:00:11    
education, and outreach. This is by Brian K. Hall.    
1:00:16    
This is on the past, present, and future of Evo Divo. So, this was published in 2012. So, it's a little bit dated, but    
1:00:22    
it does give us a nice view of the history of Evo DVO, where it comes from. As I    
1:00:29    
mentioned, this is something that is really kind of goes back to the 19th    
1:00:36    
century. This tension between uh Darwin's ideas, Mendle's ideas and the    
1:00:43    
embryologists and what they were doing.    
1:00:48    
So he talks about um the original paper here. So he talks about sort of the    
1:00:54    
unique case of development. So the idea is that you know we had sort of the    
1:01:01    
process We had the genes and it was interesting that Charles Darwin actually argued for    
1:01:06    
the importance of development and understanding evolution but of course the embryologists had    
1:01:13    
their own sort of track of research what they were doing. So was there was a disconnect even though there was this    
1:01:20    
recognition that development was important. Interestingly, with Mendele's research    
1:01:26    
and and sort of uh his model of heredity in terms of genetics,    
1:01:32    
people started to regard development as maybe not so so important in    
1:01:37    
understanding evolution, which was interesting because for one    
1:01:42    
thing, we knew about genes theoretically at that time, but we    
1:01:48    
didn't really have good genetics techniques that we could actually look at the genes that were involved in    
1:01:54    
development. So it was kind of a black box where we couldn't really get at the mechanisms    
1:02:00    
for development especially in terms of evolution. So it was kind of left out the shelf for a while.    
1:02:08    
Now in this paper um Paul says research over the past two decades this is    
1:02:14    
basically the 90s and as this when this paper was written has opened that black    
1:02:20    
box revealing how studies in evodo highlight the mechanisms that make genes the genotype the structures the    
1:02:27    
phenotype this is vitally important because genes do not make structures developmental processes make structures    
1:02:34    
using road maps provided by genes but using many other signals as well.    
1:02:41    
Physical forces such as mechanical stimulation, temperature and the environment in interaction with chemical    
1:02:48    
products produced by other species. And you know this is just kind of talking about all the things that are    
1:02:54    
involved in developmental processes and how they come to bear uh evolutionary    
1:03:01    
change. Not only do genes not make structures or the phenotype. So you know    
1:03:07    
genes don't make phenotypes and morphological structures on their own. There are a lot of layers to this where    
1:03:14    
genes are expressed. There are different actions of cells or different actions of    
1:03:19    
phenotype itself that go on these changes. But new properties and mechanisms emerge during    
1:03:25    
embry development. Genes are regulated differently in different cells and places.    
1:03:31    
Aggregations of similar cells provide the cellular resources or modules from    
1:03:37    
which tissues and organs arise. Modules and populations of differently differentiated cells interact set    
1:03:44    
development particular tracks and organisms interact with their environment to create their niche in    
1:03:50    
that. So a lot of these phenomena are pouched    
1:03:56    
under this term epigenetic. And of course the term epigenetic is uh    
1:04:02    
notoriously difficult because there's one set of meanings of epigenetic    
1:04:07    
meaning everything that is beyond the control of genes. So epigenetic is    
1:04:13    
anything that ABM is involved indirectly in some    
1:04:19    
process of expressing a gene or is the indirect product of expressing a gene.    
1:04:25    
Epigenetic however also has another meaning and it's very specific in    
1:04:30    
genetics which is that there are these epigenetic regulators or uh things like    
1:04:36    
methylation tags other types of epigenetic mechanisms that actually you know we can look at    
1:04:43    
them much in ter in the way that we look at population genetics.    
1:04:49    
And so we can understand we can use both of these terms or both of these ways of    
1:04:54    
viewing epigenetics and the effects of development to get a better handle on    
1:05:00    
the approach. So, this paper kind of goes over a lot    
1:05:07    
of this.    
1:05:21    
So if you're interested sort of in the antecedence of there's this paper McCain    
1:05:27    
2009 she analyzed thousands of papers published between 1975 and 2004    
1:05:34    
and was interested in the impact of Conrad Wington on Eye. And so Hinrad    
1:05:40    
Wington of course was a developmental biologist who worked in about the midcentury mid    
1:05:47    
20th century and he came up of course with epigenetic landscapes and some    
1:05:52    
other insights and so but then of course he influenced a lot of people later and    
1:05:59    
you have to remember of course again that development was not something that we usually associated with evolution at    
1:06:08    
least not formally. literature. So people were doing development, people were doing evolution    
1:06:13    
and then bringing those two things together was a challenge. Wington um you know he made some conjectures about    
1:06:20    
evolution but not really working directly in that area. Um and then of    
1:06:26    
course you had people who would use Wington's work as inspiration for them thinking maybe closely about evolution    
1:06:34    
being able to bring those two things together.    
1:06:39    
So there's really no founding figure of evil. You could say maybe Wington was a    
1:06:45    
founding figure, but Wington never really coined the term, nor did Wington    
1:06:50    
ever really do significant amount. It's synthetic work. see if he wants to    
1:06:56    
go. But the term evolutionary developmental biology appears to first    
1:07:02    
have been used in print in 1983 by the zoolologist and later environmentalist Peter Callow. So Peter Callow maybe is    
1:07:09    
the founding father so to speak of the field but this is not you know this is    
1:07:15    
again there are people working in the area maybe they use the term evo maybe they didn't but um I think there's a    
1:07:22    
trend though we could say from about bringing evolution development more closely.    
1:07:30    
And so call was sort of a pioneer in this area,    
1:07:35    
writing a number of books uh on sort of how you know how do you incorporate    
1:07:41    
things like life history, life cycles into different types of use.    
1:07:48    
He provided an influential treatment of life cycles from developmental evolutionary and physiological princip.    
1:07:56    
So that gave him sort of in to thinking about development and evolution mostly    
1:08:03    
and then physiology being wide field that allows you to make a lot of these connections.    
1:08:10    
Callo included a chapter on evolution and development in itself unusual at the    
1:08:15    
time in his 1983 book evolutionary principles    
1:08:20    
published by Blackie in their tertiary level biology series. Tow described the    
1:08:25    
field of evolution development as evolutionary developmental biology noting that the area is a relatively new    
1:08:32    
and complex so the reader should not expect to find fully comprehensive treatments in the literature.    
1:08:40    
And so in this uh inaugural publication, call emphasized that natural selection    
1:08:47    
could and didn't did act at any stage of the life cycle of desolate organisms. A    
1:08:53    
conclusion reached by one of the founders of evolutionary embryology 109 years ago. So there were precursor areas    
1:09:00    
like evolutionary embryology, but again this is kind of like the application of evolution to any field. wasn't really    
1:09:08    
that you know it was kind of thinking about embryology first and then evolution kind of as a aside    
1:09:15    
uh in it in his first paper on shark development Francis Balfur argued for the role selection and embryionic    
1:09:22    
development is perhaps even more relevant for evolution selection of the adult so this was the uh work that was    
1:09:31    
sort of the beginnings of evolutionary so this was a British person who worked    
1:09:38    
on sharp development used this as sort of the model for what they were    
1:09:43    
interested in. So this is from 1874. Uh I see no reason for doubting that the    
1:09:49    
embryo in the earliest periods of development is as subject to the laws of natural selection as is the animal at    
1:09:56    
any other period. Indeed, there appear to be grounds for thinking that it was more.    
1:10:03    
So an interesting kind of point here is that this is kind of mirroring the work    
1:10:11    
of a lot of the comparative embryologists in the 19th century. So they would have    
1:10:17    
they would look at embryos of both chickens and humans similarities in those embryos and of    
1:10:24    
course you know at the gross phenotypic level you can see those similarities and    
1:10:30    
you can say things but from the at the genetic level of course are very different and but but as we found out    
1:10:38    
there are similar processes working across species that uh have a common    
1:10:44    
ancestor. that actually have this    
1:10:51    
that provide you know they're different but they're also    
1:10:59    
so there are people like uh Steven Jay Gould 1977    
1:11:04    
who proposed these connections between development and evolution that honor in 1982    
1:11:11    
and you had other people who published things in the 80s through the teens as    
1:11:17    
this paper cites as the roots of Evo deep. And so you know there were a    
1:11:24    
number of different people who did seinal early work in this era.    
1:11:33    
So Ernst Tel of course was one of these 19th century embryologists and he had a    
1:11:40    
theory that anttogyny recapitulates phology. That is    
1:11:46    
as you go through the tree of life you find that the developmental system is    
1:11:54    
recapitulated. So when you get you can get evolutionary changes where you can    
1:12:00    
get younger versions of other organisms that are related. So you can have    
1:12:09    
uh evolution to juvenile traits across you know over time. And so this is not    
1:12:16    
this this theory was proven to be sort of disproven. Uh and so but but the kind    
1:12:23    
of idea persisted. There's something about development that is relevant to    
1:12:29    
biological. You can see traces of the developmental process being moved around    
1:12:35    
or sculpted. It's common process that then is changed in different organisms    
1:12:40    
and that leads not only to changes in development but changes in the phen adult phenotype in these different tax    
1:12:48    
that you see. So, you know, you might have, say, for example, a developmental,    
1:12:53    
as we find out later, a developmental um period that's expanded or a    
1:12:59    
developmental period that's contracted. And that can lead to the changes in the growth of different traits. And so,    
1:13:07    
that's one evolutionary change we see. There are other changes related to    
1:13:13    
autogeny uh or development that involve changes    
1:13:19    
in basically things like speciation or plogenesis.    
1:13:25    
And so of course all this was way beyond Hegel and you know you'll hear often    
1:13:30    
people say that Hegel was proven wrong which is true to an extent but Hegel's ideas persisted as these early    
1:13:38    
observations and so embryos provided a way to study    
1:13:44    
evolution but the theoretical framework was lagging by at least a century.    
1:13:53    
So this is a good argu article if you want to learn more about some of these    
1:13:58    
uh the history of evao not just the origins of the term but what people were    
1:14:05    
doing in the 19th and 20th centuries to set up um this advance this theoretical    
1:14:14    
okay so that's the theoretical aspect now there some papers some seinal papers that kind of led up to this as well    
1:14:22    
wasn't just observing ing embryos and say, "Well, yeah, they look very similar, so we can like look at the    
1:14:28    
phenotype and we can sus all the evolutionary details out." I mean, that    
1:14:34    
would be nice if true, but we also have to have a more rigorous    
1:14:39    
uh set of analytical. And of course, we want to draw from    
1:14:45    
genetics because as I said, you could observe commonalities in the phenotype, but the underlying genetics are very    
1:14:51    
different. And so people started doing genetic studies in the 70s and 80s and finding    
1:14:58    
these sort of principles for ego. So there are a number of uh bedrock    
1:15:06    
uh cornerstone findings in ego and a lot a lot of times this forms a basis for    
1:15:12    
theory. So one of those theory or one of those bedrock ideas is uh that of uh    
1:15:20    
hawk segmentation and colinear. So that is you have this set of genes    
1:15:26    
called hawk genes this family of genes that get expressed in sequence and those    
1:15:32    
set up different segments of the feet. So if you go to the fruit flood    
1:15:37    
drosophila, they have a number of body segments that are basically encoded by    
1:15:44    
these conserved hawks genes that are on the chromosome in order and they're    
1:15:50    
expressed in order and they are conserved from evolutionary change. So they don't exhibit a lot of variation.    
1:15:57    
In fact, it's essential that they be highly conserved in order to function.    
1:16:03    
So this is the paper from 1978. This is a nature paper. This is a gene complex    
1:16:09    
controlling segmentation in versa. This was EB Lewis    
1:16:14    
and this is just the original study where they discovered this gene complex    
1:16:20    
and how it controls the segmentation in the field. And of course the segmentation happens in all. So you get    
1:16:26    
the expression of these hawk genes. It sort of sets up coordinate system more or less where these different segments    
1:16:35    
and of course if you've ever looked at insect you have these different body segments from anterior to posterior and    
1:16:43    
the you know the order of these genes and also as they would later find    
1:16:49    
duplication of these genes can lead to changes in the field    
1:16:54    
or sometimes preserving the same    
1:17:00    
So the abstract of this is the bithther gene complex in drosophila. Bithther    
1:17:06    
means that it's two thoraxes by thorax. So the thorax gets expressed twice.    
1:17:14    
Uh contains a minimum of eight genes that seems to code for substances controlling levels of thoracic and    
1:17:21    
abdominal. So this is where they have these segments in the thoracing and    
1:17:26    
abdominal area of the insect. State of repression is at least four of    
1:17:31    
these genes is controlled by cy regulatory elements and a separate locus    
1:17:37    
called polycode which seems to code for a repressor of the complex. So you see, not only are    
1:17:43    
they finding these genes, they're linking them with the phenotype, but they also have these regulatory elements    
1:17:51    
and gene networks that are or gene regulatory networks that are involved.    
1:17:56    
So a regulatory element of course is a upstream piece of DNA that basically    
1:18:03    
determines whether some gene will be expressed and then you get different um    
1:18:10    
transcription factors and signals from other genes in the genome. So there's a    
1:18:15    
separate this polycom that is a repressor of the regulatory element and    
1:18:21    
can repress the expression of the oxygen. The wild type and mutant segmentation    
1:18:27    
patterns are consistent with an anterior posterior gradient. So this again is up    
1:18:33    
and down the body with these different segments in the repressor concentration    
1:18:38    
along the embryo and a proximal distal gradient along the chromosome in the    
1:18:44    
affinities repressor of each genesis regulatory. So this is where we have this gradient    
1:18:51    
in the phenotype and this repressor concentration varies across the    
1:18:58    
phenotype front to back and it determines how these genes are expressed.    
1:19:04    
Then you have this gradient along the chromosome. So you have again a linearity. These genes are wind up along    
1:19:10    
the chromosome and there's this effect of this repressor element that lessens    
1:19:18    
as you chromosome. So we're linking together genotype and    
1:19:24    
phenotype. So all this is to say that there's this discovery that we have the segmentation    
1:19:31    
in the phenotype. As you can see here, this is controlled by elements of the    
1:19:37    
genotype. We can make the argument that you know this is shared across taxa across fogyny    
1:19:47    
that it's conserved from a common ancestor. So, as we might expect, if we    
1:19:52    
have major changes in this gene complex in this this uh group of genes, we can    
1:19:59    
end up with serious defects in the phenotype. But we can also end up with    
1:20:04    
these they call hopeful monsters or large scale changes in the phenotype. Uh    
1:20:09    
the the likelihood though is that more often than not, this will lead to something delterious.    
1:20:15    
And so that's kind of the idea that these hawk genes are    
1:20:20    
product, you know, a product of evolution, maybe conservation and evolution and leads to something phenotype. You    
1:20:27    
can tinker with the hawk genes a little bit and get different changes in the phenotype that represent changes across    
1:20:34    
species. So that's the insight and then of course we have this uh this is a figure here,    
1:20:41    
figure one this shows genetic control. So they worked out the circuit and how    
1:20:46    
this works and then how this works across the So this is very nice work from 1978    
1:20:55    
and again this was underros soft but then of course work on hawk jeans and other    
1:21:01    
tax other parts of the tree of life as well.    
1:21:17    
So another finding is that of conserved sequences. So like I    
1:21:22    
said conservation is a key concept in you don't want to change genes too much    
1:21:30    
um that are involved in development because if development is disrupted    
1:21:35    
significantly the survival of the organism is disrupted significantly affecting its fitness. So a lot of times    
1:21:42    
you can have changes in development and there are a lot of changes we're not going to get into a lot of findings    
1:21:50    
where you change the phenotype like for example if you change pack six uh    
1:21:55    
expression and development you can end up with a different number of eyes and so that can affect the survival of maybe    
1:22:03    
some organism and it affects its ability to reproduce.    
1:22:08    
So you don't necessarily see that phenotype uh propagated. You may also have    
1:22:15    
developmentally lethal mutations. So sometimes in if these developmental    
1:22:20    
genes get mutated, they can lead to nonviable feedback. So that organism    
1:22:26    
can't even complete development. So this is a very important part of evolution because it speaks directly to    
1:22:32    
reproductive fitness. This is a paper uh this is a article    
1:22:39    
that leads to an another original paper. This is a conserved sequence that sparked the field of evo.    
1:22:47    
The abstract of this paper talk they talk about the homeotic genes in Drosophila    
1:22:53    
that these homeotic genes are conserved and utilized for embryionic development throughout the animal kingdom. not just    
1:23:00    
in insects, orchid, uh, drosophila, uh, species, but also in humans and all    
1:23:07    
throughout the animal king. And it's worth saying that there's    
1:23:12    
another analogy to that in plants called Madsbox genes. So Madsbox genes operate    
1:23:18    
the similar way to hawk genes in animals. Um, but in any case, you see this sort    
1:23:25    
of role of development. Um in a pair of back-to-back papers    
1:23:31    
published in cell the journal cell in 1984    
1:23:36    
uh they were researchers showed that the homeobox genes previously identified as    
1:23:41    
a sequence shared by homeotic genes in Drosophila were also present in the genome genomes    
1:23:48    
of diverse animals. all across uh different tax across biology. The    
1:23:56    
first paper which is McInness 1984 we'll see this in a minute showed that    
1:24:01    
genomes of both invertebrates and vertebrates so invertebrates and vertebrates alike    
1:24:06    
contain sequences that cross- hybridized with Drosophila homes.    
1:24:12    
That means is that these homeobox genes that you see actually probably    
1:24:18    
the common ancestor of vertebrates and invertebrates. So this is something that's deeply conserved    
1:24:26    
and has a deep fogyny in animals. The second paper kasco in 1984    
1:24:33    
identified a cross- hybridizing sequence in the model system zenapus leavus.    
1:24:39    
They then isolated the first vertebrae box containing gene by cloning and    
1:24:44    
sequencing the corresponding gen region. Zenapus is the frog. So that's where we    
1:24:50    
are in fogyny. Uh finally they showed that this gene    
1:24:56    
AC1 later named hawk C6 was expressed during embryionic development. The first    
1:25:02    
evidence of developmentally expressed drosophila genes abused to isolate regulators of vertebrate embryionic    
1:25:08    
development. So this is where we're looking in    
1:25:15    
lizards and amphibians seeing this same type of arrangement or this you know    
1:25:23    
homalologue to the hawk genes we see in yourself. Now it's interesting about these different studies is when people    
1:25:31    
do these studies in a model organism this or that they're different normal clatures for things. So a lot of times    
1:25:37    
in genes you have different nomenclature sometimes they're homologues    
1:25:43    
but they you know they have to kind of how these are related in terms of    
1:25:50    
sometimes they'll use what they call like a homology uh analysis where they see the    
1:25:56    
similarity between genes in terms of sequence. Um sometimes they you know look at how    
1:26:02    
it's expressed and you know basically make the connection between two    
1:26:08    
different nomenclature systems and how those genes have changed in development    
1:26:13    
and evolution. So it's it's interesting how you know we work across these model    
1:26:19    
organisms and have you know can make these findings.    
1:26:27    
These findings led to a flurry of activity in the evo field. So this was from 1984 forward    
1:26:34    
initially focusing at isolating hawk genes across diverse species and then    
1:26:39    
expanding to isolation in other gene families based on ortholog.    
1:26:45    
So orthologs are these genes that are homologous    
1:26:51    
and they retain similar functions across fogyny    
1:26:58    
and they might have a little bit different But they do have this sort of    
1:27:03    
common function. So we can actually use orthogons as well to look at sort of the    
1:27:11    
common ancestry these different hawks.    
1:27:16    
This led to the notion of a conserved genetic toolkit form currently accepted but unexpected at the    
1:27:23    
time of its discovery. So this is the thing that really kind of is a key finding of Divo is this conserved    
1:27:29    
genetic tool meaning that it doesn't necessarily change a whole lot of cross biologic and it provides us means to    
1:27:38    
execute embryogenesis execute a phenotype.    
1:27:44    
That all being said, of course, the genome is not sort of the origins    
1:27:51    
or, you know, it's the ultimate origin of phenotype, but it isn't the full    
1:27:56    
contribution of phenotype and for that you need to go to environmental effects and epigenetic effects and that's    
1:28:04    
another sort of theme in evil. We attempt to provide some context for    
1:28:09    
the sea change in thinking that these discoveries brought about by referring to Jean PJ's theories about the    
1:28:16    
sequential action of scientific knowledge. So this sequential action    
1:28:22    
and you know this idea of sequential acquisition and Petti    
1:28:28    
theories of development. It's really an interesting parallel because Petti    
1:28:34    
development are largely psychological but you can see that sort of pattern of    
1:28:40    
develop or of acquisition in sequence. So you need to acquire things in a    
1:28:46    
sequence or have work properly and of course the sequence is enforced by the    
1:28:52    
sequence the gene but of course if you disrupt that sequence then often times you end up with these    
1:28:58    
developmentally phenotypes. Yeah, that brings us to our last paper.    
1:29:04    
This is the McGinness paper from 1984 or I should say McInness    
1:29:14    
and this is uh called a homologous protein coding sequence and resopiotic genes and its conservation and other    
1:29:21    
metaz. Basically, it's these hawk genes that    
1:29:27    
are homologous across species. Protein coding because they produce proteins.    
1:29:33    
Um, and then this is in Drosophila genes.    
1:29:39    
So, it's a specific type of gen. And then it's conserved in other    
1:29:44    
medicine, other animals. So, what you see in your soph isn't necessarily exactly the same thing you see in frogs.    
1:29:52    
or in other animal species that have them, humans or have you, but they're    
1:30:01    
similar in terms of sequence and then also similar in terms of their function,    
1:30:07    
but that's more general. They focus here on sequence and that's kind of the point of the paper. So the    
1:30:15    
summary reads the homeotic genes complex ex- C and the antennopedia complex    
1:30:23    
entros. So there is also the bithther complex of course but there's also the antennipedia    
1:30:30    
complex which deals with the antenna of drosophila and there's a similar kind of    
1:30:36    
system uh appear to specify the developmental fate of segments or parts of segments in    
1:30:42    
the fly. So you have the etherax thorax the antenna area and all of those    
1:30:50    
operate with this homeotic gene. So the entire phenotype is organized in this way. Uh we have previously reported weak    
1:30:59    
DNA sequence homology between three prime portions of the antennopedia and    
1:31:04    
flushy churzu genes of the antltherax genex.    
1:31:11    
So u Antennipedia and Fushi Turzi were involved in the antennipedia complex and    
1:31:18    
ultraithra is involved in the bithax complex.    
1:31:25    
Here we show that this DNA homology or the homeobox is due to a conserved    
1:31:30    
protein coding sequence present in these three pattern formation genes. the    
1:31:36    
functional homology between these developmentally developmental controlling genes is reflected in the    
1:31:42    
structural homology in their gene products. So in other words you have this sequence similarity you have a    
1:31:50    
functional homology in terms of what it produces and then this is uh reflected    
1:31:57    
in the structural homology of the sequence of the gene. So you have guess    
1:32:03    
in this case they're looking similarities sequences of both the genes the protein and then    
1:32:09    
that translates into the phenotypic symbol.    
1:32:18    
The homeoblock sequence is also present in a few copies in the genomes of some other invertebrates and is even    
1:32:24    
conserved in vertebrate genomes including the human genome. Apparently at least a part of these Switch genes    
1:32:32    
and versophila are highly conserved during evolution might perform an    
1:32:37    
analogous function in many mechanisms. So this is where we talk about the sort    
1:32:43    
of way in which these genes are conserved, their sequences are conserved, the gene products are    
1:32:49    
conserved and then they play a role that's very much conserved in the    
1:32:56    
anterior and posterior organization and other axial organiz types of    
1:33:03    
organizations. And this shows this in    
1:33:13    
This just shows how this is organized in showing some of these genes and how    
1:33:18    
they're how they're where they're located in the genome. And what they mean by homeobox gene is    
1:33:25    
that it's a box of genes and regulated    
1:33:31    
transcription factors. And they're all regulated kind of as a group and as well as conserved as    
1:33:40    
a lot of times genes if they're tightly located on the chromosome    
1:33:46    
they're conserved because they don't undergo or they're less much less likely to under sort ofation.    
1:33:59    
And so this is a lot of uh molecular biology and sequence alignment. So I'm    
1:34:06    
not going to get into that, but just to let you know that this is some of the work the ways in which they were doing    
1:34:11    
this back uh decades ago. Um and you know they    
1:34:16    
didn't really uh have the kind of tools we have now. I'm not sure if this was I mean I'm    
1:34:23    
really impressed with the kind you know it's always impressive to go back to like 80s and see how they were doing    
1:34:30    
because it was not easy. Okay. So that's all I have to say about    
1:34:36    
uh the origins of Evo Divo and some findings early findings of Evo Depot.    
1:34:43    
All right. Well, thanks for the original question and I hope everyone
