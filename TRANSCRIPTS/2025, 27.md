Hello. Hi. Where's Susan?    
0:10    
Hello. Hi. I'm just uh Yeah,    
0:16    
just I'm just here. I haven't done anything this week except right.    
0:21    
Um thank you for the paper by the way. The mechanical Okay. What What paper was that?    
0:30    
Um, what was it called? Mechanics of Oh, no. I didn't. Epithe    
0:37    
epithelial cell stability based on mechanics something.    
0:43    
Yeah, something like that. Yeah, I I think I did have it, but it looks good. So,    
0:49    
okay, I'll I'll find it. It's in my um in my other folder. Download. It's in the    
0:55    
downloads folder, of course. Okay. Well, Lilith, how are you? Hello,    
1:02    
Morgan. All right. Um, Susan, did you have any updates on the    
1:09    
things you're doing? No, I've just been, like I said, cleaning.    
1:15    
Very boring, but has to be done. So,    
1:20    
right. Um, and Lewith, do you have any updates or    
1:27    
anything you'd like to talk about? Uh, hi everyone. So I kind of uh was    
1:35    
working on the visualization and I have I mean like I've updated them this    
1:41    
Friday to Bradley and uh and few other people and uh yeah I'm I'm trying to    
1:49    
understand uh uh how do I have to visualize the you know the centations    
1:56    
part I mean like now I have the labeled data that was given by you know the    
2:01    
nickel part So from that can I you know use those labels can I do some analysis    
2:07    
and do some kind of plotting based on the I mean like my previous plotting I    
2:13    
mean like what what I have done in the Friday week to probably I'll try to mix those two things up and probably bring a    
2:20    
nice update in the next week meeting so that I can show the difference I mean    
2:25    
like when we have the cintium data and you know suppose I have a cintium and    
2:31    
I'm trying to find it out and from the which close proximity and which lineage information it's actually aligning with.    
2:38    
So yeah, I'll probably code it a bit in this week and I'll bring some good    
2:44    
updates next week. So that's the plan. Good. As of now trying trying out and uh uh    
2:53    
Gordon has been sending lots of papers and you know it's kind of overwhelming at a point.    
3:01    
uh feeling out and reading them or like that.    
3:08    
Yeah, I try to keep them to various aspects of the brain. Yeah. Okay. Uh Susan shared a couple    
3:16    
papers in the chat. The first is the mechanical stress driven by rigidity sensing governs    
3:23    
epithelial stability and then the second is molecular jackhammers    
3:29    
eradicate cancer cells by vibrronic driven action. That's interesting. So that's a like an    
3:37    
applied paper. Yeah,    
3:42    
I guess be careful when you're using ultrasound on cells. You might be    
3:48    
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That may also apply to human    
3:53    
embryos. Yeah.    
4:00    
Okay. Right. Yeah. I want to get into um a couple things today. Okay. Uh the first    
4:07    
is talking about something called Lrronian structural    
4:13    
uh tools that we can use to look at cellular systems and look at dynamical    
4:18    
systems. So this is an example of a a lrangeian    
4:24    
coherent structure which I'm going to talk about. Um and this has been applied in um fluid mechanics and it's been    
4:32    
applied in applied physics but you know it hasn't really I mean it's found    
4:37    
different application domains and until very recently you know it's been some    
4:43    
semi useful for biology but people have been publishing interesting papers on    
4:49    
how to apply this technique to developmental biology particularly embryogenesis.    
4:55    
So this is an example of a lrangeian and coherent structure. The idea is you have    
5:01    
this turbulent flow and in this turbulent flow you have these structures that form. If you put in a tracking die    
5:09    
where if you have a bunch of particles that are diffusing through a liquid and it's this turbulent flow you can get    
5:15    
these structures that are um what does coherent mean? Uh well the    
5:21    
coherence is that they're uh they form patterns or they form these um I guess    
5:27    
an incoherent structure would just be something that's kind of drifting along and not um concentrated like some of    
5:34    
these are. So you have these examples here where you can identify the    
5:39    
structure. Those change over time I assume. Yeah, they evolve and change, but the the    
5:45    
point is isn't that like they exist and are pleasing to the eye. The point is    
5:50    
that you can use mathematical tools to make a statement about the structure. So    
5:56    
there's this, you know, um some of the flow will depend on    
6:02    
viscosity, right? Right. Right. Well, they they do this in different types of flows and the    
6:08    
idea is that mathematically you can identify a ridge and those ridges kind of move over time and they diffuse    
6:16    
and you end up with different measures that you can use to characterize them    
6:21    
and they're related to the lrangeian mathematical tools as we'll see. So    
6:27    
that's uh kind of what that looks like. And then this is the Wikipedia article on Lrronian coherent structure. So this    
6:34    
was something that was discovered by George Hower's group at I think MIT    
6:41    
um in the meta and they kind of have been developing this cottage industry    
6:48    
where they've been working on different application domains for this and so um    
6:55    
lrangeian coherent structures or LCS's are distinguished surfaces of trajectories in a dynamical system that    
7:03    
exhibit a major influence on nearby trajectories over a time interval of interest. So usually you have like some    
7:10    
origin point Z and then you might have a diffusion of particles and those    
7:16    
particles diffuse outward and you might have this turbulent flow that you know    
7:21    
takes up the particles and they move around and they end up forming these clusters or these ridges that diffuse    
7:30    
outward. So if you think about like throwing like u you know fish food into    
7:35    
a a pond, it usually just falls and then diffuses away. If this were a turbulent    
7:42    
flow, you'd throw it in and it would follow the turbulence and would form these ridges where you'd have um you    
7:49    
know concentrations of the fish food. If you think about ocean gyers, it's kind    
7:54    
of a similar thing where the ocean guys aren't turbulent, but they have this flow that you know where you if you put    
8:03    
something in the ocean and you know something ends up in an ocean guy, it    
8:08    
ends up circ uh circling and circling the same part of the ocean and it gets trapped there because the flow is sort    
8:15    
of governing its movement. And then eventually you can get things like garbage patches where you get all sorts    
8:20    
of plastics kind of concentrated in the same place. It's a function of the flow    
8:26    
that you're in. So this is uh these are individual trajectories in a model flow. If you look on the right    
8:33    
and this is you know these are these kind of uh concentrations of things. We    
8:39    
can use a model which is using a lrangeian to describe it. And you can also do this experimentally where you    
8:45    
use the lrangeian but you don't use it to sort of form the um the tra or you    
8:51    
you observe the trajectory instead of modeling. So that's kind of you start    
8:56    
with this initial condition and you end up going um down these paths.    
9:03    
And so there's a sensitivity to initial condition. So you start off at a certain location and you measure from that    
9:10    
initial condition out to the current position. So it's a like a dynamical any    
9:16    
dynamical system you can have a discrete version and you can have a continuous version and you measure out from the uh    
9:24    
initial condition as many time steps as you would like and you can observe the evolution system.    
9:31    
Okay. Um, sensitivity to initial conditions is a definition of a chaotic    
9:37    
system. Yeah. Yeah. So, it I mean it does. So, if you're in a turbulent flow, you have    
9:43    
the potential to have a chaotic system there. Um, it you know, it sets up the conditions for that. So, yeah, it it    
9:49    
very much does feed into that. Although I'm not sure how much people have kind of made the connection between LCS's and    
9:57    
chaotic systems or things on the edge of chaos or whatever.    
10:06    
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Taking that into account, it says attracting model LCS. Are those in    
10:13    
any sense attractors like in chaotic systems? um    
10:18    
uh I don't know what they mean here exactly but I guess you would have sort of attractor points in the system. So    
10:26    
like in a dynamical system usually you have an initial condition and then there's some attractor points that can    
10:31    
be described. Similarly if you had a flow that was I guess if you had a    
10:36    
deterministic flow you definitely have attractor basins or attractor points. If    
10:41    
you had a turbulent full that was maybe uh chaotic, you might still have    
10:47    
attractor points. Uh they actually talk about saddle points in here. So you're talking about yeah these stable points    
10:54    
or these attractor points.    
11:03    
Okay. So this is kind of talking about how these are used and and so basically what    
11:11    
you do is you have this initial condition. You have these uh conditions of evolution. You're measuring the    
11:17    
system using the lronian where you're describing the system using a lronian and you're measuring the evolution    
11:22    
through this trajectory and you end up with this skeleton of the overall dynamics of the system. So you're    
11:29    
basically uh so uh in the figure up here individual tracer trajectories which is    
11:36    
where they might put a die in a liquid or they might put a die on some particles and look at the trajectories.    
11:43    
These trajectories form coherent patterns that are generally sensitive with respect to changes in their initial    
11:50    
conditions and the system parameters. In contrast, the LCS's creating these    
11:56    
trajectory patterns turn out to be robust and provide a simplified skeleton    
12:01    
of the overall dynamics of the system. Um, the robustness of the skeleton makes    
12:06    
LCS's ideal tools for model validation, model comparison, and benchmarking.    
12:12    
LCS's can also be used for now casting, name, and short-term forecasting, and pattern evolution in complex dynamical    
12:20    
systems. So that's maybe a a semicconnection to chaotic systems. I    
12:26    
don't now casting I'm not really sure what that is. It's a new term for like knowing what the current state of a    
12:32    
system is or monitoring things in the environment. And then short-term forecasting is knowing how something is    
12:39    
going to unfold in the short term as you can't necessarily say things about the long term in these kinds of systems.    
12:46    
like Canadian weather predictions.    
12:52    
So yeah, it's so it's basically um you know, I guess it's an improvement on    
12:57    
some of the techniques that we've used to look at dynamical systems and    
13:02    
certainly is you know it gives you a very strong mathematical framework. So,    
13:08    
um, uh, physical phenomena governed by LCS's    
13:13    
include floating debris, oil spills, surface drifters, and chlorophyll patterns in the ocean, clouds of    
13:20    
volcanic ash, and spores in the atmosphere. So, a lot of things that you might expect for, you know, measuring    
13:27    
collective behavior or measuring things that are kind of in a fluid. Um and so    
13:34    
yeah this and then just just goes through some of the mathematics of it and how this is uh characterized.    
13:41    
So that's uh a little bit about that. Um    
13:47    
this is a paper that um is newer and this is called objective oilering    
13:52    
coherent structures. So this is kind of a another So this uh George Hower    
13:59    
uh was you know sort of described these in the mid as so this is from 2022 actually I    
14:06    
guess it's 2015 but also 2022 I don't know how that maybe it's an updated    
14:12    
version but anyways this is on a different uh tool called Oilerian    
14:18    
coherent structures or objective oiler coherent structures and this is using an    
14:24    
oileran. So, uh the abstract here reads, "We define objective oilerian coherent    
14:30    
structures or OECS's in a two-dimensional non-aututonomous    
14:36    
dynamical system and instantaneously most influential material curves. Um, OC    
14:43    
OECS's are stationary curves    
14:48    
of the averaged instantaneous material stretching rate or material sharing rate functions. So they're able to look at    
14:55    
these in terms of materials instead of in flows. From these objective frame and    
15:01    
vari variational principles, we obtain explicit differential equations for hyperbolic, elliptic and parabolic    
15:08    
OECS's. So they're linking this to different types of differential equations to    
15:13    
describe these sorts of phenomena. This is not just now this is not only a flows this is it um in in active materials    
15:23    
as illustration we compute OECS's in an unsteady ocean velocity data set in    
15:29    
comparison to structure suggested by other common diagnostic tools we find    
15:35    
OECS's to be the correct short-term cores serve trajectory deformation patterns so    
15:42    
they kind of get into some of the tools that are used um talking about uh LCS's.    
15:50    
So um just talking about coherent structures more generally um which look at pattern formation and    
15:57    
non-steady flows. Um they've looked at variational techniques in terms of how    
16:03    
they're used to identify langian coherent structures. So this is prior work    
16:09    
and then this is uh talking a little bit about how this is being generalized and    
16:14    
then using an oilerian um as sort of a standin for that. So all    
16:20    
LCS's however are intrinsically tied to a specific finite time interval over    
16:26    
which they exert their influence on nearby trajectories. So in LCS methodology you have an initial    
16:33    
condition you evolve the system evolves to these uh structures these skeletons    
16:41    
and then they have this influence on nearby trajectories and that only you know it's kind of    
16:47    
shortterm prediction. This influence is an integrated one filtering out    
16:52    
short-term anomalies in the flow. Yet short-term variability in material structures is often seen as significant    
16:59    
and highly unsteady flows explaining the popularity of oileran    
17:04    
instantaneous velocity based diagnostic fields and fluid dynamics. So, Oilerian    
17:10    
methods build upon the LCS methods that they described earlier and that are    
17:16    
being applied to systems and give this short-term uh description of the system    
17:22    
and methods kind of build on that and maybe give you perhaps a better characterization.    
17:30    
So, this is kind of the mathematical background here. Um    
17:36    
and so this paper is um this p so there was a    
17:44    
paper in 2020 that described this uh using lrangeian coherent structures in    
17:50    
terms of talking about maybe things in development. Okay. So this is I don't    
17:56    
think I have that paper today but um this this paper talks about coherent structures and active flows on dynamic    
18:03    
surfaces and this is u Matias Sarah who worked    
18:09    
with George Hower on some of this stuff and so he's been busy applying this to developmental biology and some of the    
18:17    
data that will describe different in uh developmental systems and we'll talk    
18:23    
about that in another paper. So the abstract of this reads, coherent    
18:28    
structures or flow features that organize material transport and information    
18:34    
are central to analyzing complex flows and fluids, plasmas, and active matter.    
18:40    
Yet identifying such structures on dynamic surfaces remains an open challenge,    
18:46    
limiting their application to many living and synthetic systems. So you know we talked about how you can apply    
18:54    
the bronian coherent structures to fluid flows to particles and fluid flows and    
18:59    
then the trajectories they take forming structures and then we talked about    
19:05    
methods which kind of build upon that and then now you know we still have to    
19:10    
think about how do we apply this to living systems or synthetic systems that    
19:15    
have biological components. Here we introduce a geometric framework    
19:20    
to extract lrangeian and oilerian coherent structures from velocity data    
19:26    
an arbitrarily shaped time evolving surface. So again these are surfaces and    
19:33    
these are kind of using these ma mathematical tools to describe    
19:38    
um you know the time evolution of these flow or of these structures and you know    
19:44    
the idea is that they're flowing on surfaces and this will become useful because of    
19:50    
course when we're talking about fluid flows and particles it's easy we're talking say about a tissue or an embryo    
19:57    
of cells that are migrating past on a two-dimensional sheet or you know    
20:02    
in a threedimensional volume then that's a little bit different and we need to describe it in a different way because    
20:08    
there are a lot of mechanical influences that are not just fluid flows there are    
20:13    
other things as well so that's what we want to do we want to extract these lronian and oiler coherent    
20:20    
structures from velocity data our method operates directly on triangulated meshes    
20:26    
avoiding global parameterizations while preserving objectivity and robustness similar. So they're using    
20:33    
these triangulated meshes to describe the system instead of like the typical    
20:39    
just kind of free uh flow. And so uh applying this framework to active    
20:45    
pneumatic vesicles collectively migrating epithelial spheroids and    
20:50    
beating zebra fish hearts. So they have these three different systems. Of course, we talked about active materials    
20:55    
and pneumatic uh or you know organization where you have things that are oriented in one direction. So you    
21:02    
might have a bunch of rodshaped cells that are all oriented in one direction and of course their flow is going to    
21:08    
look different than the flow of semeic oriented cells that are oriented    
21:16    
different directions. And so that's going to affect the dynamics. And you    
21:21    
can describe of course the the flow of a pneumatic uh uh cell sheet or a spectic cell sheet    
21:29    
using this technique. Then of course we have epithelial spheroids that are migrating collectively. So they're all    
21:35    
moving in different maybe they're all moving together or they're moving in slightly different directions. They're    
21:41    
being influenced by noise. So we want to be able to describe those dynamics. and    
21:46    
then beating zebra fish hearts where you have cells that are I guess migrating cells that are stationary and you have    
21:53    
movement through the system. So you want to be able to get u an active    
21:59    
description of those different types of systems. So using these different types of    
22:04    
systems they uncover hidden transport barriers and lrangeian deformation    
22:10    
patterns such as dynamic attractors repellers    
22:15    
isotropic and an isotropic strain. So they have of course the attractors, the    
22:21    
propellers, so places where things are sort of stable or equilibrium points,    
22:28    
you know, points that are avoided by the system. And then you have these different ways to describe strain    
22:35    
and this is all these are all things that are missed by conventional oilan analysis. So this is something that is    
22:42    
added to that description. This approach offers a new perspective on soft and living matter, revealing how    
22:49    
geometry and activity can be harnessed to program synthetic materials and how    
22:55    
lrangeian strain and principle deformation directions and help uncover    
23:00    
mechano sensitive processes and directional cues and morphogenesis.    
23:06    
So I know like Oregon is interested in the synthetic materials and programming    
23:12    
synthetic materials. Um so this is kind of interesting that this is a tool for    
23:19    
that sort of thing. Um yeah we're interested in these active matter flows    
23:26    
um where we're interested also not just in active matter flows but on curved surfaces. So when we're talking about    
23:33    
the the bronian coherent structures initially we're talking about maybe like    
23:38    
a two-dimensional surface although you're talking about a fluid flow it's usually a threedimensional surface but    
23:46    
you know we want to be able to describe this on a curve on a curved surface. So if we have like a curved sheet of    
23:52    
epithelium cells or something with curvature we want to be able to describe that and not just the very flat two    
23:58    
dimensional case. Um and so this is useful in a lot of areas of biology and developmental    
24:05    
biology. Uh recent advances in live imaging and computation have enabled the    
24:11    
reconstruction of such flows across systems ranging from developing embryos    
24:16    
to engineered active pneumatics. So people are engineering materials that    
24:21    
have those these sort of pneumatic properties in them and they want to figure out how you know to get that you    
24:29    
know to get that sort of thing in engineered systems. These flows are spatially heterogeneous    
24:35    
and temporarily unsteady driven by internal activity and influenced by    
24:41    
surface curvature and topology. While kinematic velocity or trajectory    
24:46    
data become increasingly available, its analysis remains challenging yet    
24:52    
essential for controlled material transport or discovering the underlying biohysical mechanisms.    
24:58    
So they get into these coherent structures and their description. So they kind of classify londian and    
25:06    
oilering structures together and these provide a reduced    
25:11    
representation of complex trajectories organizing material transport and deformation.    
25:18    
Um and so they're actually what they point out here that coherent structures are typically objective as we saw in the    
25:25    
last paper there's this objective oilerian um method and so what they mean by    
25:31    
objective is that this that these uh systems are invariant to the choice of    
25:38    
coordinate system adopted to describe motion. So it's not dependent on the coordinate system. It's invariant to    
25:44    
that and it's robust to noise which is useful because biological systems have a    
25:51    
lot of noise in them. Okay. Um coherent structures have been broadly applied in    
25:57    
science and engineering. We talked about this uh in active    
26:02    
pneumatics. recent work elucidated the connection between coherent structures and topological defect motion    
26:10    
revealing the interplay between flow structure pneumatic order. So this is something where um we have these    
26:17    
descriptions of different types of skeletons in flows and then we have    
26:24    
topological defects and you know the role of motion. So a lot of times we    
26:30    
want to describe uh topological properties of something. We have you know we have mathematical    
26:36    
tools for that but we also want to describe you know maybe things like defects or things like uh movement and    
26:45    
some of the noise around those sorts of things. So these are great tools for    
26:50    
kind of modeling the idiosyncrasies of life and living systems.    
26:57    
They forgot something. These uh structures are often in tension. If    
27:02    
they're a confluent tissue, if they're attached to each other, then they're in tension.    
27:08    
Okay. So, they that's um sometimes they're not    
27:14    
attached to each other in an embryo. It varies. Yeah. But um they're often attention    
27:22    
structure. Yeah. which adds to the dynamics.    
27:29    
Correct. Correct. Yeah. Yeah. Brad Bradley also made a statement that there's a lot of noise in an    
27:35    
embryo. Yeah. Has anyone actually studied that? Oh, yeah. I mean, I don't have any    
27:42    
papers on me right now, but there's there have been a lot. Now, I don't know if you mean in in individual cells or in    
27:50    
the entire embryo. The entire embryo maybe. Well, I guess yeah, there are papers on that. like with respect to    
27:57    
okay the papers on noise correction well yeah I think so as well but it's    
28:03    
you know it's like um I think there could be more work in that area let's just say but yeah I think    
28:11    
there are I we'll have to put together some papers on that and this is at the    
28:17    
level of the embryo yeah I mean the the the closest we've    
28:24    
got to that is variation between twins for example. Yeah.    
28:30    
Uh and uh you know has that been quantified at all? Uh and uh does it fit into these    
28:37    
float patterns at all? Um no I've seen well I've seen things on    
28:43    
noise correction. The one that's coming to mind is where they're doing stuff with uh positional information and    
28:50    
looking at noise positional information, things like that. Um, but I'm sure    
28:56    
there's probably stuff I don't know about uh in terms of twins or things like or like    
29:04    
variation of the same genotype, I guess, is what you're saying. Um, yeah, I don't I don't know. I have to look in the    
29:10    
literature for that. I think one one one term that's a very old one is    
29:15    
fluctuating asymmetry. Yeah. Yeah. That's so Oh, is this a paper that Okay. So,    
29:22    
this is a terraima at all multifunctional physical reservoir computing and soft tenseity    
29:29    
robots. That actually applies to what we're talking about. Okay. It's a method of looking at tensities.    
29:37    
Oh, okay. which is the tensioned structure which cells are if they're a    
29:42    
confluent tissue right so this applies it's just that I've    
29:48    
never heard of physical reservoir computing before so    
29:54    
anybody know anything about that what well I think the reservoir well    
30:00    
reservoir computing is where you have like a like a box a black box and you    
30:06    
have a bunch of uh it's it's like a neural network. You have these neurons where just like nodes in a network and    
30:14    
they're all connected randomly. Then you feed data into it and it kind of sorts it. It self-organizes and sorts the data    
30:21    
and it produces this output. So it's like a technique people are using sort of as a rival to neural networks and u    
30:29    
it's hard to really describe what it's actually doing but it's uh it produces    
30:34    
some interesting results and I imagine the physical reservoir networks might be like a physics inspired instantiation of    
30:43    
that. I'm not really sure what the physics part of it is but that's that's what our uh reservoir networks are and    
30:50    
they're really and I you know um hard to really grasp what they're    
30:55    
actually doing. So,    
31:01    
so yeah, those are uh things to look into. So, yeah, this is, you know, just kind of one technique and they're kind    
31:07    
of uh casting it onto the data in in a a sense. Um but, you know, it's it's    
31:14    
interesting what they're kind of doing early days for this. Um so uh let's see    
31:22    
where are we here um so they also talk about so they talk    
31:27    
about active pneumatics work then they talk similarly lrangeian coherent structures revealed new cumulative    
31:34    
deformation patterns and dynamic boundaries and multisellular flows    
31:40    
robust to noise and experimental variability or remaining undetected by oiler quantities these structures    
31:47    
provided new insights into morphagenetic mechanisms, pattern formation and selfie bifurcations.    
31:53    
While existing uh techniques cover general two and threedimensional flows,    
31:59    
flows defined by sparse noisy trajectories or flows on static surfaces. They remain unavailable for    
32:06    
flows on dynamic surfaces which are of course defined biology. So they talk    
32:12    
about they actually have their code here in mat lab and python. So these are some    
32:17    
of the images of how this looks on a curved surface. So you have these lrangeian structures showing this    
32:24    
geometric skeleton of these flow fields. So you have these spheres, you have this    
32:30    
at time zero on the left, time t / two on the right on the second to the left,    
32:37    
then time large t and then the lrangeian deformation. So you get this uh so you    
32:44    
get these uh black uh points. These are the unsteady velocity fields. So you have them    
32:51    
pointing in a certain direction. So you can see that the black see if I can zoom in. These black lines are velocity    
32:59    
field. So the arrows are going in a certain direction and the direction is changing as you go along the sphere.    
33:06    
Okay. And then you have these red. So you have the lrangeian deformation grid    
33:13    
which is in red. So this is the grid here. It's this network and it doesn't look you know random and it doesn't look    
33:21    
regular. It has it follows these flow fields. So it's describing the flow fields and it's showing that. All right.    
33:29    
So that's uh in red. And then if we look at so it's a growing spherical surface.    
33:36    
The sphere is growing from t0. And so we have this deformation grid. We    
33:42    
have these velocity fields. And then in B which is lrangeian deformation which    
33:48    
is on the right we have a an example of a lrangeian coherent structure or a set    
33:53    
of these marking regions of maximal material contraction or attraction over    
33:59    
zero to t that interval. So this is where we have low levels    
34:05    
uh I guess of of material attraction which is material contraction then high    
34:12    
levels of material attraction and you can see that like in the low levels the    
34:17    
uh the skeleton or the lrangeian deformation grid is sparse and then the    
34:23    
areas where you have a lot of material attraction you have very dense uh    
34:30    
deformation. So that's what this looks like. That's what they mean by deformation. It's kind    
34:36    
of deforming the grid to conform with material flows on on the sphere.    
34:44    
Okay. Now, Bradley, if they ran that twice, would it look the same? Um, well, probably not because the the    
34:51    
unsteady velocity field would change, so it might look different. I'm not really    
34:57    
sure, but I'm not I know it's not deterministic. So, okay. Has anyone investigated under what    
35:03    
conditions it would look the same? You'd have to make the velocity fields deterministic.    
35:10    
But in that case, I mean, if you're growing it at a steady rate and the velocity fields are deterministic, then    
35:16    
it will it doesn't give you I mean, it gives you information the first time, but I mean, I don't know if it would    
35:22    
look any more regular. It might look regular. Not sure. Well, I'm just trying to imagine what it would take in terms    
35:29    
of uh feedback or uh interactions between these points to make it to make    
35:38    
the result look similar. Okay. Yeah. I don't know.    
35:44    
Okay. So, in other words,    
35:50    
why did two embryos from the same brood look the same? Right.    
35:56    
And as maybe has something to do with the interactions between    
36:01    
the velocity field. Okay. So that's really not investigated    
36:08    
at this point. Yeah. Yeah. So the the deformation grid I mean I'm    
36:15    
trying to think of the analogy embryo be kind of like like signaling molecules or    
36:20    
something be sort of conditioned by a flow field and it would kind of    
36:26    
determine pattern formation or something and if you had a deterministic flow field or deterministic concentration of    
36:35    
of different molecules you would get very similar results. Yeah. See, that's where things like bio    
36:41    
electricity might come in because uh yeah, bioelectric fields are long range and    
36:47    
therefore can organize a significant portion of the uh of an embryo.    
36:53    
Yeah. Yeah, I think that's true. And of course the bioelectric fields have their own dynamics and they could be described    
36:59    
with legalia structure. I mean the math would work basically. You would just    
37:05    
instead of having a fluid flow have an electronamic flow. You have I probably    
37:11    
have to change the equations a little bit for you have both. Well, yeah.    
37:18    
Okay. Okay. Yeah. So, uh then they go through the math of    
37:23    
labian coherent structures on dynamic surfaces. You have the lrangeian here    
37:28    
which is described by this time evolution from t0 to t. you get this    
37:34    
integration which you know gives you your F and then there are these different measurements um FDOE and FTOE    
37:42    
which are the um different measures of the coherent    
37:48    
structure from the initial condition up to this sort of ridge that forms and so    
37:53    
they're different you have like a continuous measure and a discrete measure and they modify it for dynamic    
38:00    
surfaces so that it describes sort of curvature instead of describing    
38:06    
straight lines. Um and so yeah they talk about they have to    
38:11    
define the deformation experience by material patch in the neighborhood of X0    
38:17    
and this is this B uh B term here. Um and then they talk about material or    
38:26    
maximal stretching which corresponds to the largest singular vector this B    
38:32    
component and you can quantify an isotropic lrangeian deformation using    
38:37    
this term here. So there are a lot of ways that we have to kind of change our description of these lronian coherent    
38:44    
structures or these these different measurements of that to get to this curve this curved surface.    
38:52    
and and you know in talking about deformation and    
38:57    
uh this is this figure is a labian deformation and coherent structure flows on dynamic surfaces.    
39:04    
So this is interesting in the sense that we have some actual images we can look    
39:09    
at here. Okay. Um so this is uh in a we have a    
39:15    
tissue flow. So we have this surface that's deforming and we have a flow over    
39:20    
that surface. We have a pneumatic flow. So this is an active flow on a dynamic    
39:25    
surface. And this just shows um how you    
39:31    
have this these active flows on dynamic surfaces. So flows are represented by    
39:37    
threedimensional velocities V on evolving two-dimensional surfaces M. So    
39:42    
we have these flows evolving on the surface. Um and then uh we have these    
39:48    
two-dimensional surfaces that are forming. We see that in B. We have this uh three-dimensional coordinate system    
39:55    
which describes both the surface M and then the patches which is uh described    
40:01    
here on the top as XO and then that evolves to XT. So you see that the the    
40:07    
description here the f component from our uh lrangeian description uh is    
40:13    
described on this surface here which is not deformed or it's slightly deformed and that described that's described as    
40:19    
x0 and that evolves to this xt which is this patch that's now deformed on the    
40:24    
surface uh that's evolved over time. So this is basically this description but on this    
40:31    
sort of deforming surface. Okay. So then C is um the material    
40:38    
deformation experienced in the neighborhood of XO which is this neighborhood here that we measured with    
40:44    
our F component and um    
40:49    
this is where it's encoded in this B component. So the purple patch here is    
40:55    
encoded in this B component which describes this area here. So this area is expanding within the patch that's    
41:02    
default. So this deforms this describes deforms material fibers    
41:08    
and then uh D is where we get these attractors and repellers. So we get this    
41:13    
sort of an isotropy within the sphere. So we get these points where things are    
41:19    
attracted to. We get these skele skeletal structures and then repellers where we get things that are sparse and    
41:26    
there are very few um descriptors in that area. So we have our    
41:32    
repellers and tractors. We start to get that. Then we get these the velocity, field, and trajectory things where we uh    
41:40    
can describe the deformation and and migration and these dynamics using a    
41:46    
discrete mesh. Yeah. So that's that's basically that.    
41:52    
And then they talk about a coherent structure that they talk about that as sort of a a longer term description of    
41:58    
the same thing. So that's enough on that paper. Um, one    
42:05    
thing I want to talk about before I get to the last paper is this concept of action. And this is in physics where we    
42:12    
have this scale or quantity called action. And so in physics and I'm just going to    
42:19    
use the Wikipedia article for you know uh for the sake of simplicity here. In    
42:26    
physics, action is a scalar quantity that describes how the balance of kinetic versus potential energy of a    
42:32    
physical system changes with trajectory. Action is significant because it is an    
42:38    
input to the principle of stationary action, an approach to classical mechanics that is simpler multiple    
42:44    
objects. Action in the variational principle uh can be used in different    
42:51    
physical domains. And so in the simple case of a single particle moving with a constant    
42:57    
velocity, therefore undergoing uniform linear motion, the action is the    
43:02    
momentum of the particle times the distance it moves added up along its path. Equivalently, action is the    
43:10    
difference between the particle's kinetic energy and its potential energy times the duration for which it has that    
43:17    
amount of energy. So you can do that for sort of the kinetics and then maybe    
43:23    
what's more interesting for us is where we can look at the trajectory itself and    
43:29    
look at the mathematical function which takes the trajectory    
43:35    
which is also this history of the system from point uh from the initial condition time zero to whatever time we're looking    
43:43    
at. pull out a number of time steps to get to this uh prediction and we get    
43:48    
this this trajectory that describes the kinetics of the system. Um so    
43:56    
which takes the trajectory of the system as its argument and has a real number as its result. Generally action takes    
44:03    
different values for different paths. So when you get different paths then of course we know that like we have this    
44:09    
variational aspect which means that we can have different types of paths. We have different types of paths for    
44:16    
different cells and sometimes we uh take the mean value of those paths. Sometimes    
44:21    
there are different paths in maybe like an embryo. If we measure say a thousand    
44:27    
segans embryos, if we look at the path of a cell as it migrates and we find    
44:33    
that overall it's basically the same but there is variation in those paths. It's slight variation as it is but it does    
44:41    
kind of give you this uh variation to deal with. And so you know we want to be    
44:47    
able to understand that in terms of the action and action ends dimensions of    
44:52    
energy times time or momentum times length ends and uh we do this for units    
44:59    
of jewels per second. So this is something that we want to think about not just the uh kinematics but the    
45:06    
kinetics as well. So that brings us to the last paper which is an application domain in    
45:13    
developmental biology. Like I said I don't have the uh 2020 paper    
45:20    
u on sort of a general application of this to uh developmental biology because    
45:28    
I thought that was kind of a broad overview but this is actually a very focused overview of uh vertebrate    
45:35    
gastrolation. So this paper is a mechano mechanochemical model that recapitulates    
45:42    
distinct vertebrate gastrolation. So this is applying this LCS methodology    
45:48    
to a specific embryo a specific thing in development.    
45:54    
So the abstract reads during vertebrate gastrolation an embryo transforms from a    
46:00    
layer of epithelial cells into a multi-layered gastro. This process    
46:05    
requires the coordinated movements of hundreds to tens of thousands of cells. So there are a lot of cells that are    
46:11    
moving and they're coordin have to be coordinated and we want to be able to    
46:16    
describe it in the chick embryo. Patterns of ectomyioin cables spanning    
46:22    
several cells drive coordinated tissue flows. So we have these acttomyiosin cables that are intracellular or intra    
46:30    
intracellular and they're coordinating these tissue flows and so we want to be able to    
46:37    
describe those flows in terms of maybe like a skeleton or this these sorts of    
46:43    
uh structures. Here we derive a minimal theoretical framework that couples ectomyiosin    
46:50    
activity to global tissue flows. We want to know this acttomy these acttomyiosin    
46:56    
cables. How are they contributing to the global flow of tissue? Our model predicts the onset and development of    
47:02    
gastrolation flows in normal and experimentally perturbed chick embryos    
47:07    
in making different gastrolation bones. Is it active stress and stability?    
47:13    
And so um this means that we have a change in how    
47:18    
these acttomyosin cables are behaving and how they're sort of you know doing different    
47:25    
things. Varying initial conditions and a parameter associated with active cell    
47:31    
ingression. Our model recapitulates distinct vertebrate gastrolation    
47:36    
consistent with recently published experiments in the checkout rate. Although our results show how changes in    
47:42    
the patterning of critical cell behaviors associated with different force generating mechanisms contribute    
47:49    
to distinct vertebrate gastillation modes via self-organizing mechanochemical process.    
47:56    
So this is a figure here where they talk about these ectomyosin cables. This is    
48:02    
figure one and this drives the tissue flow gastrolation. So this is where we have uh these    
48:10    
different structures forming the primitive streak. Um this is an A. So A    
48:17    
is this PS formation diagram. And then in B we describe the velocity.    
48:22    
So what we're doing is we're describing these velocity fields. In the chicken we want to describe sort of the uh the    
48:31    
speed at which the cells migrate. We can measure velocity as    
48:37    
a component of XY position and time.    
48:43    
Um and the convergent extension of the mis misoenderm red which is red here    
48:51    
generates macroscopic tissue flows on the surface of the embry. So as this red    
48:56    
zone is changing it's misoender and it's kind of squeezing together and    
49:01    
pushing up like that. You see that in figure A this is changing this flow field. So you    
49:08    
can see the full field is changing in terms of velocity.    
49:14    
Uh see at HH1 which is this first time step the misoinderm cle territory is    
49:21    
characterized by supercellular cable. So this is the sickle formation here and    
49:27    
then you have the formation of these these cables that they describe.    
49:33    
Um these are supercellular cables with active meiosin phosphoralized meiosin    
49:39    
like chain PMLC and this is perpendicular to anterior posterior so it's going in this    
49:46    
direction here across the sickle from left to right    
49:51    
um and then let's see um    
49:58    
okay uh where are we okay um and then at HH3 12 hours after HH1 which is this    
50:06    
thing on the right here where you've got this squeezed in the opposite orientation.    
50:12    
Uh the PS is characterized by supercellular cables with high active meiosin PMLC perpendicular to the mid.    
50:21    
So now this is perpendicular into the midline like this but this region has    
50:26    
changed its its sort of orientation. Um the pattern of macto meiosin cables    
50:32    
evolves from EJK XIV to HH3. Bar lengths represent the PMLC and    
50:39    
isotropy and bar. So they're referencing EKG XIV is down here in E which is where    
50:47    
you see these active acttomyosin cables and they have the orientation    
50:53    
and the intensity. And so that's these different uh parameters here. And so we're measuring    
51:00    
this as kind of in the same way we're measuring velocity. We're measuring this x y coordinate system with time. So    
51:08    
we're looking at the intensity here of these active meiosin cables. We can see that we have these intensities change    
51:15    
with the with the shape of these structures.    
51:21    
And so then that that kind of shows a little bit of that evolution here. Um    
51:26    
you start to get the primitive streak forming. You can see some stains in these images here with C and D. And then    
51:34    
this tells you the relationship between these equations. So the uh the velocity    
51:41    
is related to the orientation and the orientation is related to the intensity    
51:46    
and the intensity is related to velocity. They all kind of play upon each other. orientation, velocity and    
51:52    
intensity all play a role in each other's you know in in their dynamics.    
51:59    
Okay. So then they talk about the mathematical framework. This is a predictive model linking mechanochemical    
52:06    
activity and tissue flows. And so for for a minimal model we want    
52:12    
to have a planer mechanochemical predictive model for formation or PS    
52:17    
formation during gastrolation. So we have these three coarse grain fields. The tissue velocity field which    
52:23    
is V and then these other components within it. Um the active stress    
52:29    
intensity M r arising from meiosin activity the average cable orientation    
52:35    
which is described here. So we talked about those in the last figure. And the limit of slow viscous flow is associated    
52:42    
with morphogenesis. we can neglect inertia so that the local force balance    
52:48    
reads this where the total stress is the sum of the viscous and active stresses.    
52:54    
The viscous stress is where P is the pressure, I is the identity matrix and U    
53:00    
is the sheer velocity and this S component which is the deviatoric rate    
53:05    
of the strain tensor. The active stress associated with ectomyiosin cables is    
53:10    
this term with the components of B given by this term here. So they model the    
53:17    
sheetlike embryo for two in two dimensions as they described with their X and Y coordinates. This is a    
53:23    
compressible fluid um that allows for cell ingression into a third dimension.    
53:30    
Okay, so that's a little bit about that. Then they kind of talk about the they    
53:36    
have this uh definition of stress here in this figure which is where we have    
53:42    
stress as force balance. So we have viscous viscous component where we have    
53:47    
shear and uh dilotation and then we have active which is on this    
53:53    
side of the plus sign this active component this viscous component on the other side.    
53:59    
So that's the force balance. Then the other component of stress that are the dynamics of active stress orientation    
54:06    
where we have this adection term here we have rigid rotation and we have sheer    
54:11    
induced rotation that's additive across the system and then we have the dynamics    
54:19    
of active stress intensity which is where we have infection recruitment dissociation    
54:27    
saturation tension propagation which leads to the induction of M which is here. So that's    
54:33    
all sort of this active stress intensity.    
54:40    
Okay. So um and then of course they quantify the spatio temporal morphogenetic flows    
54:47    
uh they use their theoretical model and this is where they get into this LeBronian coherent structures    
54:54    
methodology. Um, and this paper I talked about from 2020 describes this kind of    
55:00    
tool called dynamic morphoskeletons. So, this is not something I'm covering today, but if you want to know, it's a    
55:07    
citation 44 in this paper. These are these dynamic morphoskeletons, which are basically these bronent structures that    
55:15    
describe morphological structures in embryos and in other developmental systems.    
55:23    
Um and so the DM is based on a lrangeian description tissue deformation captured    
55:29    
by these finite time leaponov exponents which are FTOE's. So I talked about how    
55:35    
you have the finite the FTOE and AFDOE which are two tools. So you have the    
55:40    
finite time exponent and I think it's the finite    
55:46    
discrete lienov exponents as well or something like that. So there are these different measures of the branch    
55:54    
structures. Now in terms of the FTOE those that type of measure combines    
56:00    
local and global mechanisms along cell trajectories. So as we saw we're measuring from the initial condition to    
56:07    
some end point that end points like a ridge and those ridges describe    
56:13    
the skeleton. So that's you know local and global mechanisms. The DM consists    
56:19    
of attractors and repellers toward which cells converge or diverge over a specific time interval t. So this is    
56:26    
from initial condition to the time of interest. Repellers are marked by high    
56:31    
values of the forward FTL. And while attractors are marked by high values of backward FTL.    
56:39    
So you have this forward and backward component. Um and this is kind of    
56:44    
defined by these two uh parts or these two regions of the face.    
56:50    
Um and then um attractors are marked. Okay. In their    
56:56    
domain of attraction by high values of the backward FTO displayed on the initial cell populations here.    
57:03    
Um so they give this so they have the supplemental figure six which I'm not    
57:09    
going to get into but that illustrates it. The uh DM reveals the organizers of    
57:15    
spatiotemporal trajectories and is robust to noise. Hence it is an ideal    
57:20    
model for quantifying morphogenesis and comparing models with experiments.    
57:26    
So this just kind of shows active forces in the chick embryo where they have this    
57:32    
experiment and model comparison. Um    
57:38    
then you have this developmental perturbations of gastrolation where they perturb the system. Um they have I guess    
57:45    
this is uh maybe this answers your question Dick. Um so they have    
57:50    
spontaneous twin perturbation repeller and attractor for model velocities and experimental velocities. This is a twin    
57:59    
model where you have repellers and attractors. And this is an experiment where you have repellers and attractors.    
58:06    
This is VEGF inhibition where they in inhibit VEGF which is a molecular uh    
58:12    
signal for development for gastrolation and you can see that it changes things.    
58:21    
You have FGF2 addition. So you add FGF2 in and then you have uh BMP and GSK3    
58:30    
inhibition which are other molecules that are involved in this process. And when you inhibit BMP and GSK3    
58:38    
you really lose any sort of morphogenesis. It just becomes this big blob. And you    
58:44    
see this in the experiment. You see this in the models. The model is more idealized in the experiment but it's    
58:49    
replicating what you see in the experiment. So this is just an example of how can predict these kinds of    
58:56    
patterns and and dynamics. And so then they go towards a phase base    
59:02    
of gastrolation flow patterns where they want to pro provide a face-based    
59:08    
description of gastrolation related flows. So um to go beyond studying the    
59:15    
gastrolation modes we use chemical inhibitors to uncouple cell interpolation and aggression and perturb    
59:22    
the initial patterning and function of the perspect pro perspective messenderm is described in a recently published    
59:28    
experimental paper and so u we that shows that we can recapitulate these    
59:34    
phoggenetic variations in the morphodnamics of vertical gastrolation    
59:39    
um where you're coupling the dynamics of the acttomyiosin cables to large scale    
59:45    
tissue flow patterns. Uh so they've done this in experiment and they wanted to sort of replicate this computation or    
59:52    
rep replicate this using this kind of phase space dynamical systems.    
59:58    
Okay. So they basically can make successful predictions    
1:00:03    
and um this is a figure here of the evolutionary transitions and gastrolation pattern. So they go big for    
1:00:11    
the final figure and they show that like if you want to they had a heading in there said that at reptilian mode what    
1:00:18    
they're doing is they're doing the experiments in check doing the modeling in check and then they want to look and    
1:00:23    
see if they can do this in reptiles as well. So in the chick you have a primitive streak because it's um in in    
1:00:32    
birds and then in reptiles you have the blastoporal connect. So that's what they're looking they're looking at these    
1:00:38    
two homologous structures and they're looking at their formation and    
1:00:43    
experimented model. So they're actually looking at the initial condition. So you    
1:00:49    
have the sickle modeled here and you have this sickle where there's a reduced messender and then you have the sati    
1:00:57    
zero. This is the initial condition. This is the initial condition for amphibians antilio fish. and amphibians.    
1:01:04    
Of course, we have this blastoapore in antilio fish. We have the germ ring. So, again another part of this uh vertebrate    
1:01:13    
plate where we have chicken reptile here and then amphibianist fish here is sort    
1:01:19    
of the out group or the out groupoups. So, we have this sort of ancestral condition here where it's this ring. We    
1:01:26    
saw that ring before, but it was like where we inhibited certain factors in the chick embryo. Now it looks very    
1:01:32    
similar to what we see in in what's shared between amphibians and tioest fish. And so we use that for our um    
1:01:41    
ancestral condition there initial condition and then we start to look at the evolution. So we look at how this    
1:01:48    
process unfolds in these four tax this developmental process of cell ingression    
1:01:55    
and cell interpolation. So you can see there are different patterns of it throughout and you can describe this    
1:02:00    
with this mathematical model but you're also what you're doing is you're changing the conditions under which this    
1:02:06    
migration happens. Okay.    
1:02:12    
So I think that's all for that. Um any questions any comments? Any inspirations    
1:02:18    
we have to say? I guess I just wanted the reference for the first paper you    
1:02:24    
went over because um the different flows.    
1:02:30    
Yeah. Uh this was the    
1:02:36    
this one here inherent structures and active flows.    
1:02:41    
Yeah, I think so. It was the first one. I missed the reference. Let me see if I could get this is a    
1:02:47    
preprint bioarchchive. Get the chat    
1:02:53    
there. That's the bioarchchive link. And then this is the title here. I'm not sure if    
1:03:00    
this is out in a journal. It's pretty new. So, probably not yet,    
1:03:07    
but it's okay.    
1:03:14    
I'll copy it over and look for it. Okay. Yeah.    
1:03:21    
Any other thoughts? I think flows have a lot to do with embryology.    
1:03:27    
Oh, yeah. Okay. That's all for today. Why don't we call it a day?    
1:03:35    
See you next week. Thank you. Bye.
