Hello. Morning. Morning. Hi.    
0:10    
So, Paul, how are you? How are things on your end? Uh, things are uh fine. I have no major    
0:18    
updates. Okay. Yeah. So, I guess we can get started. Um    
0:26    
so I have a couple of papers here on uh sort of self-rerodction and minimal    
0:31    
chemistries. I think one of them uh was pointed to by    
0:37    
um Hussein. I think it was in the Slack where he pointed out this paper. It's a    
0:43    
new paper on the origin of life. There's also the paper on the minimal    
0:48    
chemotactic cell and then a paper on reaction networks. in thermodynamic    
0:55    
space. So I'm going to go over those and talk about their implications and things like that.    
1:04    
Okay. So the first paper is this uh new paper. Um it's called self-rerodction    
1:11    
is an autonomous process of growth and reorganization in fully abiotic    
1:17    
artificial and synthetic cells. So this has a lot of relevance to early life    
1:23    
stuff and especially some of the things we've been talking about in this group off and on uh for the last couple years.    
1:31    
So their interest is in sort of thinking about self-rerodction    
1:37    
and how to build a model of that or a minimal model of that. So when I say    
1:43    
minimal model, you try to build a model with the minimal components that makes a    
1:50    
system work. You don't try to over complicate it, but it should demonstrate, you know, the mechanism of    
1:57    
what you're trying to achieve. So for an early life model you know we have these minimal models of cells which are these    
2:04    
vesicles which are these just basically empty uh containers and then we put    
2:10    
things in the container to try to initiate biochemical reactions and some    
2:15    
of these behaviors that you see in very simple cells. Um and so you know we we I    
2:22    
guess associate with life things like reproduction uh being able to carry a genetic code    
2:28    
and of course uh there were RNAs out in the world before there were cells but    
2:35    
one of the things about the cell which is modeled by this um vesicle is that    
2:40    
you can do that within a container and it protects it from the environment and it has its own sort of self-containment.    
2:49    
So this is the kind of the background as to why this is a really interesting problem. And then of course this the    
2:55    
organ self-organization of this process meaning that it comes from uh basically    
3:02    
from no real template. There's no uh earlier form of this. So you know when    
3:09    
cells evolved uh there was no cell to to to come from. It just had to kind of    
3:15    
self assemble on its own. Um and this happens of course again with ukareotic    
3:21    
cells where you get organoid or organels in the cells    
3:26    
inside the cells and you make this uh jump in and this transition in    
3:32    
evolution. So the significance of this paper is self-rerodction is one of the    
3:38    
most fundamental features of natural life. So this is again stating this like    
3:44    
basic fundamental thing about cells and natural life and and    
3:49    
this study introduces a biochemistry free method for creating self-reroducing polymeric vessel vesicles. So they're    
3:56    
actually interested in this biochemistry free method which I'll describe in here.    
4:02    
In this process, non-amphilic molecules are mixed and eliminated with green    
4:07    
light initiating polymerization into amplifiles that self assemble into    
4:13    
vesicles. Uh these vesicles evolve through feedback between polymerization    
4:18    
degradation and cheosmotic gradients resulting in self-rero.    
4:26    
So you have this vesicle um you are putting in this uh these    
4:33    
non-amprophilic molecules. You're activating them with a green light or you're illuminating them and then this    
4:40    
initiates polymerization and then this creates these amplifiles that self assemble and then this self    
4:46    
assembles into vesicles. So uh we start with no vesicle. We start with these    
4:52    
nonophilic molecules and we build this these steps to um these vesicles that    
4:58    
we're interested in. And so they identify the steps needed for them.    
5:04    
As vesicles grow they polymerize their contents leading to the their partial release and the reproduction into new    
5:11    
vesicles exhibiting a loose form of heritable variation. So again this is not like the kind of cell that we see    
5:18    
today. This is a minimal model of a cell basically doing this thing and you know    
5:24    
I guess we can make parallels between the cells of today and this model but the idea is just to sort of give a rough    
5:32    
approximation of the process. This process mimics key aspects of    
5:37    
living systems offering a path for developing a broad class of abiotic lifelike systems. So, of course, we've    
5:45    
talked about um in the past, we've talked about minimal cells. We've talked about uh some of the programmable    
5:53    
materials and things like that. So, this kind of fits into that area. I mean,    
5:58    
there are things there are reasons why you would want to do this other than sort of looking at the origins of life.    
6:04    
if you'd want to do this maybe for some um bioengineering    
6:09    
uh application or you know things like programmable matter etc.    
6:16    
So this this is the abstract. Among the characteristics shared by all extent    
6:22    
living systems, their chemically controlled self-rerodction ranks perhaps as one of the most    
6:28    
spectacular and exclusive. Under the control of their internal chemical networks and in tight    
6:34    
relationship with their environment from where they harvest food, energy and information, natural living systems    
6:41    
spawn representations of themselves or reproductions. and said they define    
6:46    
reproductions as these representations of themselves as fully functional systems which also autonomously in under    
6:54    
sufficient similar sufficiently similar conditions to those of their progenitors    
7:01    
are again capable of self-reproduction in generations. Indeed, when living systems reproduce,    
7:08    
their species continues to exist via their progeny and propagates as such into the future, also enabling    
7:15    
fundamental aspects of their Darwinian evolution due to the generation of reproduction of populations which    
7:23    
include heritable variation. So we need to make that step up to something that can undergo Derwinian evolution, have    
7:31    
heritable variation that's heritable across cells and um be able to create    
7:38    
new generations that can be selected and things like that. So that's that's kind of but we we have to start with building    
7:46    
a structure for that container for that. And again, you I want to stress that    
7:52    
these aren't like actual cells that you see today because the actual cells we see today. The membranes have a lot of    
7:58    
things going on. Um, you know, they're pores and receptors on the membranes and    
8:04    
the membranes are made of, you know, complex materials with multiple different molecules contributing to the    
8:11    
surface. So, we don't really have any of that. we just have a base container and    
8:16    
then we're loading things into things that are going into it. So it's like a bag of of reactions basically. Um and so    
8:28    
at an extent biochemistry based life even for the simpler single cell living system such as bacteria the process of    
8:36    
reproduction is complex and involves many complicated and coordinated steps. So this is again when we see    
8:42    
reproduction cells today. There are a lot of steps to that uh like to a cell    
8:48    
division or you know things like that. So we're not really modeling much of    
8:53    
that here. These take place within the cell under the precise control of biochemistry and collectively constit uh    
9:01    
constitute the cell division cycle CDC. So of course the cell division cycle is    
9:07    
initiated by the expression of a number of genes in sequence and of course you    
9:12    
have you know uh different phases under the which the cell cycle operates and    
9:18    
sometimes those phases are expanded or shrunk down and they can affect the    
9:23    
division uh dynamics of the cells. Uh so you have this uh basically genetic    
9:30    
regulatory network in modern cells that control cell division cycle. So uh cells    
9:36    
can proliferate or they can not proliferate as a given context based on that uh that network.    
9:43    
Now we don't have that in vesicles but we just want to see some sort of reproduction. And you can imagine in    
9:50    
early life you had some mechanism for reproduction that didn't involve this the cell cycle uh and then eventually    
9:57    
the cell cycle emerged um in the cell. So we don't we're not really answering    
10:02    
that question directly, but we're recognizing that the biochemistry when they say biochemistry free the    
10:08    
biochemistry they're referring to is something like the cell cycle where there's a initiation of a of you know    
10:18    
gene expression and that constitutes a gene regulatory network and those things    
10:24    
are regulated in time and they produce this coherent output of uh cell division    
10:32    
uh like Versaw said in 1858 omniscellular eellular or every cell    
10:39    
comes from our pre-existence cell. So this is again with respect to say like    
10:44    
bacteria or ukareotic cells that cell division is comes from previous cells    
10:51    
and then those cells are now the product of of like you know developmental    
10:58    
precursors to that but we're always kind of coming from a pre-existing cell    
11:03    
pre-existing template. Okay. Um however we may ask is extant biochemistry    
11:11    
with its delicate and welltuned complexity over billions of years of evolution on earth necessary for a    
11:16    
protocellular chemical system to reproduce. So the protocellular chemical system is the thing they're focus on    
11:23    
here. When they see, you know, they're talking about the delicate and well tuned complexity of biochemistry,    
11:29    
they're talking about these processes like cell division where we have the biochemistry in place and does we don't    
11:36    
need to reinvent the wheel to see how that works. Um but in these in these    
11:41    
vesicles we don't have that. Um, can one construct in the laboratory    
11:47    
non-biochemical compartmentalized chemical systems capable of autonomous    
11:52    
self assembly and self-reproduction? And of course, in this case, they're going to try to answer that question with uh    
11:59    
perhaps and then build this model. Um, answering these basic questions is    
12:05    
important for systems chemistry, artificial life or for protocell research seeking to understand what life    
12:12    
may have been like before the advent of biochemistry or last universal common ancestor or luca    
12:19    
uh during a so-called protocell era and for understanding the potential for life in the universe including exoplanets. So    
12:27    
this is just to say that this is relevant to a wide number of topics in    
12:32    
um like systems chemistry and in the origin    
12:38    
of life during the protocell era. Life must have    
12:43    
been simple. Um and they have citations for that that this is I guess a quote    
12:49    
from one of these papers. in hundreds of millions of years could have elapsed evolving the transition from chemistry    
12:57    
to some form of generalized life. So basically before you have I guess generalized life which I assume is    
13:03    
something to do with cells uh you have this chemistry that sort of you know    
13:09    
free floating chemistry where you get these reactions and you get these things that are maybe on the edge of life and    
13:15    
then this kind of uh becomes what we might call generalized life at some    
13:20    
point. And that leads us to our last universal common ancestor which is where    
13:25    
fogyny really began where you started to get you know cells that divided and then then you had changes to those cell    
13:33    
populations and then you started to get different taxonomic differences between    
13:38    
them and you'd have um you know that you was basically the start of the tree of    
13:44    
life. So that's kind of you know and then that area is very murky in terms of what the    
13:51    
steps there look like but that's what they're trying to get at. Finally these questions are also central    
13:57    
in the old but nent field of synthetic artificial life based on non-biochemical    
14:03    
material implementations of fully synthetic chemical systems capable of mimicking natural living    
14:10    
systems. And there's some citations here. So um yeah there's this area like    
14:16    
we know the artificial life conference and the focus a lot on computer simulations    
14:22    
um but there's also this area of artificial life where people go into the lab and try to create these uh    
14:28    
conditions uh for you know some sort of origin of    
14:33    
life scenario. So people use vesicles. Of course they're the Miller ray experiments that uh involved taking a    
14:41    
bunch of chemicals and putting them in a soup and then animating them under certain conditions with electricity and    
14:49    
then getting uh different chemical reactions to happen. And so there's a history of that old paper, the Miller    
14:55    
Ray paper, the original paper and then there were some replications that were    
15:01    
done later with some modifications and then there was a sort of a revisitation of that paper by the grad students of    
15:08    
Miller and they were able to get a much more robust result with modern equipment. This happened about 10 years    
15:15    
ago. So you know there is this um literature that they're building on here. Um,    
15:22    
in an effort to explore the answer to the above broad questions about the necessity of biochemistry, perhaps    
15:29    
helping to trace back's origins to the combination of carbon chemistry and the physics of self-organization.    
15:36    
Uh, and building upon the opportunities in the pre in precisely this direction    
15:42    
offered by polymerization and do self assembly or a pizza and that's something    
15:47    
that is in the literature. Um and so uh so in this case they have designed a    
15:53    
piece of batch batch reactor or an aquous solution and strictly avoiding    
15:59    
any biochemical molecules we synthesize amplifiles that self-organize self    
16:05    
assemble and self boot into chemically active myels. Okay so yeah they use boot    
16:12    
in the way that we would use uh the term boot to talk about loading a program into a computer. So that's what they're    
16:19    
you know this is of course a very strong parallel with a lot of the engineering applications that maybe they seek to to    
16:26    
do uh use this for the myels then develop into functional giant vessicular    
16:33    
systems or GVs from just a few small and low complexity molecular species chosen    
16:39    
ad hoc for us by implementing PC and so they start with a homogeneous    
16:45    
blend of several simple molecules And then uh they basically exclusively    
16:51    
rely on chemical forces controlling the exchange of atoms among molecules    
16:57    
um and then use light as a source of external energy. So that was that green fluorescent light they    
17:04    
using that as a s so they basically make it a closed system. So the only    
17:09    
source of energy they're getting is the light. The aquous thermoid and eliminated    
17:15    
reaction mixture contains a a hydrophilic polymer with a small and    
17:20    
slightly hydrophobic chain transfer agent molecule or CTA bonded at its end.    
17:27    
plus some selected monomers such as um acryin    
17:32    
trial or hydro hydroxy prop    
17:37    
methylryate or HPMA. And this can be photopolymeymerized to    
17:43    
the above hydrophilic polymer to yield amphopilic block for all molecules. And    
17:48    
finally the piece of mixture also contains at least one photoc catalyst in a firerter    
17:54    
a photoc catalyst molecule that acts as an initiator chain transfer agent and a terminator of    
18:00    
the polymerization reaction. So they're doing this sort of polymerization    
18:07    
the steps of polymerization in this uh chemical system. Um and so note that    
18:14    
this very simplified out of equilibrium system can abstractly be imagined in as a laboratory version of a warm little    
18:21    
pond where the notion of heterotrophic abiogenesis can be explored. So this is again this idea of that you know life    
18:29    
originated in warm ponds where you had uh you know energy fluxes coming in like    
18:36    
lightning or you know light energy uh like UV energy back when the earth    
18:42    
didn't have the UV protection that we have now and so that was sort of the    
18:48    
driver for the origin place. Okay. So then they go through they're    
18:53    
talking about how they switch on the illumination they're able to get these results um and they have you know    
19:00    
concentration. So as the concentration of the amplifier increases beyond its critical myell concentration    
19:07    
the activity of the chemical reactions leads us uh leads to liquid phase separation through the ongoing    
19:13    
polymerization process of the hydrophobic block and the amplifiles which eventually self assemble and    
19:19    
self-organize into my cells. So they go through this these steps of self assembly and uh uh so during their self    
19:28    
assembly in the course of the living polymerization synthesis of the amplifiers these myels entrap some of    
19:34    
the current reaction medium which guarantees the continuation of the polymerization reaction in their    
19:40    
interior although at a rate different from the one in the bulk which consequently generates and amplifies    
19:46    
osmotic radiance. So we're basically by simultaneously    
19:52    
changing the packing parameter value of the living and in this sense of limiting    
19:57    
polymerization amplify due to the increase in the length of its hydro hydrophobic block. The ongoing internal    
20:04    
photopolymerization reaction also powers the dynamical morphological evolution of    
20:10    
the myels which develop in time and become these micron scale vesicles. So    
20:16    
there's very tiny vesicles and they're self-organizing in this way.    
20:23    
Okay. So that's a little bit about the background of the paper and this is a    
20:28    
figure. This is figure one. So this shows maybe puts a little more familiar face on what's going on here. So we have    
20:37    
a here this is an illustration showing the different stages of polymer vesicle growth leading to the action of    
20:44    
expulsion of amplifiles. So this is where we have uh this is the    
20:50    
the original the starting point here we get polymerization and growth in size.    
20:56    
So we get this uh vesicle that grows in size and then these amplifiles are    
21:03    
ejected from this and that's what this is here. So we have an illustration    
21:10    
showing the different stages of polymer vesicle growth here leading to the    
21:15    
action of exposion of amplifiers. And this is a a key to the different    
21:22    
molecules that we have here. And that green light of course is in green. So you stimulate this with green light. It    
21:27    
grows and then you get these amplifiles. And then B is the illustration showing    
21:33    
the formation of new vesicles from the reorganization through self-rerodction of amplifiles expelled into the bulb. So    
21:41    
in A we see this process of stimulating the original vesicle with green light.    
21:46    
We get the growth. We get the expulsion of amplifiles into what they call the bulk. And then of course there are a    
21:52    
bunch of these in uh sort of in this medium. So you have in this case seven    
21:59    
of them or six of them and they're all expelling amplifiles into the bulk and    
22:06    
those amplifiles aggregate and then when they get to a certain density they form a new vesicle and this process can start    
22:13    
over again. So they're actually self-reroducing in this way. So this is uh the synthesis of    
22:20    
amplifiles and polymer vesicles using raft polymerization that's here where you have this u agent you have raft    
22:27    
polymerization you have the amplifiles they self assemble into these piece of mixtures    
22:34    
um B is a filtration of piece of mixture and subsequent radiation of amplifiles    
22:39    
and vess separately so you see this where you have the piece of mixture mixture you have this filter you have    
22:46    
the rate which are the amplifiles. You have the retentrate which are the vesicles. You stimulate them under a    
22:53    
microscope and you count the vesicle number growth for the vesicles. They're amplifiles which are filtered. You    
23:00    
stimulate them with green light and there should be no vesicles. So you're able to basically purify the vesicles in    
23:07    
the sample. And then C is a plot showing the growth in the number of vesicles during a    
23:13    
radiation of re uh retentrate with green light. So this is showing the number of    
23:19    
vesicles that increases over time but then plateaus at about 5,500 vesicles    
23:26    
um and just showing that you can get um certain critical number of vesicles in    
23:34    
the mixture. And then uh D is the optical image of the filtrate sampled and radiated with green light showing no    
23:40    
visible objects in the image freight. So the filtrate is this or the amplifiles and they shouldn't have vesicles in them    
23:46    
and indeed they don't have anything in them. So it's it's clear. So you see the    
23:51    
what's going on here. We have this process of reproduction. We have this    
23:58    
process of self assembly from amplifiles that have been expelled from previous vesicles. And then we have this piece of    
24:05    
mixture which we put through a filtrate. We take out the we separate out the amplifiles from the vesicles. We count    
24:11    
the number of vesicles and then we we uh make sure that there are no vesicles in the filtrate showing that those things    
24:19    
can be separated out. Okay. So that's uh this and so this    
24:24    
paper uh I think Hussein put this in the Slack or you know there was a lot of    
24:30    
excitement around it as being like this key uh key paper in early life research.    
24:37    
Yeah pretty pretty pretty bold pretty bold to call it the most important paper of 2025. That's a that's a bold that's a    
24:44    
bold one. Eh I mean um our our model that we are studying with me Dr. Gordon    
24:49    
and stuff, you know, we are doing um excuse me, our our work is um our our    
24:55    
work is empirically based. So that's not the same one as what we were talking about, but yeah. Yeah.    
25:03    
Yeah. There are a lot of different ways you can get at this problem. A lot of it, well, a lot of ways you can get at    
25:08    
it is with simulation. basically simulating a hypothesis because it's really hard to get at what actually    
25:15    
happened because you don't you know what the well we kind of have estimates of what the conditions were like but all we    
25:21    
can do are try things and see what works in the lab and then see maybe what works    
25:26    
in simulation and try to put those together so okay so that's I think enough of that    
25:32    
paper the second paper I wanted to talk about is this paper um this is from    
25:38    
science advances this This is what they call the minimal chemotactic cell. So this kind of leads from the last paper    
25:45    
but it talks about um things that you find in minimal cells that exhibit what    
25:51    
they call chemotaxis. So chemotaxis actually is quite important to see elegance and it's the    
25:57    
main way in which a lot of organisms and single cells will try to find their way    
26:02    
in the world. So what chemo what taxes are taxis are responses that an organism    
26:10    
will give to some environmental stimulants. So a good example of this is a photoaxis where you have like a source    
26:18    
of light and it's at a certain location and that light of course will there will    
26:24    
be like a gradient of light from the source that decreases the distance and    
26:29    
then you'll have like a cell or small organism that wants to move towards the    
26:35    
light because they're um photoilic say and then if they're photoilic    
26:42    
uh they'll They'll move towards the light source. They'll seek out they'll have like uh light sensors. They'll have    
26:48    
uh sensory cells that detect light concentration. And when they con when    
26:54    
they detect a higher concentration of life, they move in that direction. So you get these gradients that increase um    
27:02    
with uh closeness to the source and you get these organisms that have sensory uh    
27:08    
mechanisms that allow them to move towards that source. And so a lot of times you'll see examples of uh    
27:14    
chemotaxis or anphotoaxis where you'll have the the cell or the    
27:20    
organism will follow this path. It's not necessarily a straight path because they can't necessarily predict what the    
27:27    
gradient will look like. Um but they'll explore their local area. They'll follow    
27:33    
that gradient to the next highest concentration. So sometimes it'll look like a random walk towards the source.    
27:42    
And so they use this to find of course uh food. They find uh you know sources    
27:48    
of maybe if they need to get to some point in the water column maybe towards    
27:53    
the top they'll use uh photo taxes to do that. So that's what taxis are and you    
28:00    
can model taxes uh with things like Braenberg vehicles. Uh you can in sea    
28:06    
elegance chemotaxis are very important for them to find food. They're always going towards a bacterial food source.    
28:12    
So they need to be able to detect um you know concentrations of of certain    
28:17    
chemicals. Actually they need to distinguish between good chemicals and    
28:22    
poisonous chemicals but that's not necessarily chemotaxis. That's just another part of their uh chemosensation.    
28:30    
But in this case, we're talking about the minimal chemotactic cell. And so that's what they're, you know, they're    
28:37    
trying to figure out what the minimal conditions are for chemotaxis.    
28:43    
Okay. So, um, they start with the abstract.    
28:48    
The movement of cells and microorganisms in response to chemical gradients which    
28:54    
is termed chemotaxis is fundamental to the evolution of myriad biological    
28:59    
processes. Uh in this work we demonstrate that even the simplest cell-like structures are    
29:05    
capable of chemotactic navigation by encapsulating enzymes within lipid    
29:10    
vesicles. And again, we're using lipid vesicles and enzymes as sort of a proxy    
29:16    
for like this minimal cell. So we don't want to replicate like a we don't want to start with a ukareotic cell. We don't    
29:23    
even want to start with a proaryotic or kale cell. We want something very minimal that kind of shows where this    
29:30    
you know how minimal can we get to get this sort of behavior. Okay. So they use lipid vesicles that    
29:37    
incorporate a minimal number of membrane pores. So they do have pores in in the membrane. In this case, we reveal that a    
29:45    
solitary vesicle can actively propel itself towards an enzyme substrate gradient.    
29:51    
So they're simulating chemotaxis with this enzyme substrate gradient. the vesicles that are trying to move towards    
29:59    
the the enzyme substrate. Specifically, vesicles were loaded with either glucose    
30:05    
oxidase or uras em and embedded with corresponding transmembrane proteins    
30:12    
that were tracked with a mic within a micrfluid device under a controlled substrate gradient. So they did this    
30:19    
using a micrfluidic device. Um our findings established the system    
30:25    
comprising only an encapsulated enzyme and a single transmembrane for is    
30:30    
sufficient to initiate chemotaxis. So they actually found that you don't need    
30:35    
very much to initiate this chemotactic response. All you need is an encapsulated enzyme and a single    
30:42    
transmembrane pool. So I suspect you know for the chemical to get in at a    
30:47    
certain concentration and then the enzyme to react to it. This proof of concept model underscores    
30:53    
the minimalistic yet powerful nature of cellular navigation mechanisms providing a previously unknown perspective on the    
31:01    
origins and evolution of chemotactic behavior in biological systems.    
31:08    
So uh they talk about the cell and how they're the minimal units of life and    
31:14    
how in you know the cells that we can see in nature today are these elaborate    
31:20    
machines that operate under non-equilibrium conditions but we can build these very basic cells or these    
31:26    
minimal cells that allow us to like isolate one mechanism and see how basic    
31:31    
we can get. So we can see kind of like this ancestral form of of the thing that we    
31:38    
see today which is a wide variety of chemotaxis.    
31:44    
Okay. So again there are a lot of applications of synthetic biology and um    
31:49    
and other areas like that. Um and so yeah in this case they build    
31:55    
this minimal cell where se several cellular functions have been artificially recreated    
32:02    
including or wait a minute this is uh this is synthetic bio well they've removed actually uh translation and    
32:09    
transcription self-rerodction communication and metabolism in this case um and so they need to have some    
32:19    
mechanism for cellular transport report. Um, and among all the different motions,    
32:25    
the autonomous propulsion of cells in response to chemical gradients or kotaxis is the most common strategy    
32:31    
adopted to chase nutrients, escape toxins or control cell signal. Okay, so    
32:37    
this is just kind of going through how chemotaxis is sort of central to the    
32:42    
survival of cells. Okay, so this is figure one. This is the    
32:51    
schematic representation of a minimal chemotactic cell. Um this is where we have these lipid    
32:58    
vesicles and they form a compartment used to encapsulate enzymes. So we have    
33:04    
this lipid vesicle here with the alpha hemolyin pore single pore and we have    
33:10    
the enzymes inside. So you can see this the way they've    
33:16    
they've designed this the toxic protein HLY creates pores within the lipid membrane generating an asymmetry. So you    
33:24    
have this single pore which introduces this asymmetry uh towards the light source. So, it's    
33:30    
kind of like it's not cheating, but it's like kind of imagining,    
33:35    
you know, what might help this process along because if we had pores all across this this membrane, you know, we might    
33:42    
not be able to get a, you know, very easily get this chemotactic behavior.    
33:49    
So, we have this we create this pore uh with a toxic protein. We have this    
33:54    
enzyme inside lipic lipid vesicle. So then we put this into an environment in    
34:00    
this micrfluidic device where we have water flow and the water flow is moving it back and forth. So it's actually    
34:07    
experiencing you know it's not experiencing uh you know the sort of total totally    
34:13    
biased system. You're generating the sort of stochasticity of the flow and    
34:18    
it's moving the pore around with respect to orientation. you're getting the substrate and the    
34:25    
substrate is coming into the into the uh into the cell. You get the it reacting    
34:33    
with the enzyme here and the products are coming out into the environment. And    
34:38    
so eventually you want to have observe where this u minimal cell is moving    
34:44    
towards the substrate source. So what you do see that you have this trajectory here and the trajectory as you might    
34:51    
imagine from all this happening is this sort of random walk but it's randomly walking towards the source. So you're    
34:58    
getting this kind of movement back and forth. I mean you're not exploring all the way around the other side but it it    
35:04    
moves towards the source pretty effectively. Okay, that's figure one.    
35:12    
And figure two shows the vesicle correlation with HOI. So they're showing how they're putting holes in the or    
35:19    
pores in the vesicles and they're showing that process. Figure four shows    
35:25    
the drifting chemotactic velocities of vesicles and chemical gradients. So you    
35:30    
have in A, B and C you have liposubs encaps    
35:35    
encapsulating urase. So the first thing that they used is URAS. They have this    
35:42    
uh velocity on Y versus channel height and they get this this is the    
35:47    
measurement of HLY. Um and so they show this for let's see A    
35:54    
B and C A to C um are vesicles encapsulating uras under a ura gradient    
36:00    
of 250 micro mole per millimeter and then uh D to F which are these bottom    
36:07    
graphs or lipos encapsulating go X which is where you have uh where vesicles    
36:14    
encapsulate glucose oxidase under a glucose gradient of 50 micro multiple    
36:20    
millimeter uh panels show a through d total drift velocity in the y direction    
36:25    
as a function of channel height which is here and then b and e total drift velocity in the x direction and then c    
36:32    
to f uh so uh c to f is cheotactic    
36:37    
velocity in x calc by subtracting the x direction drift measured for control    
36:43    
vicles. So basically this uh this y velocity is it moving along or actually    
36:51    
y velocity is in a b d and then in cnf    
36:56    
you have chemotactic velocity and this is all kind of speaking to how it's    
37:02    
moving in this micrfluidic channel and so it's moving back and forth and you    
37:07    
see the fluctuations here and so let's go to the discussion um so in this study    
37:13    
we demonstrated that only a Few well-ged elements are necessary to achieve positive chemotactic propulsion for a    
37:21    
cell-like vesicle at the nano scale. Specifically, we investigated whether artificial cells could use uh chemical    
37:28    
gradients as an energy source to activate transport mechanisms and under suitable conditions be transformed into    
37:35    
the ocean. So basically they are trying to get this thing to move towards the    
37:41    
source of the chemical knowing kind of you know what the it can measure the    
37:46    
concentration and it can understand or it can't understand but it's basically measuring the concentration and when we    
37:52    
get a higher concentration it moves in that direction. We don't want it to just kind of like wander around aimlessly and    
38:00    
you know if we'd had that then we wouldn't have chemaxis. We exploited the fact that in our body    
38:06    
gradients of several metabolites are very well established. So the presence of different concentration regions might    
38:12    
affect intra and intercellular transport. We use vesicles to reproduce cell-like    
38:18    
compartments. We can find either glucose oxidase or urase within lipid membranes.    
38:25    
We form few pores in the vesicle membrane to generate an asy symmetry in the bipid layer. In this way, we met the    
38:32    
theoretical minimal conditions to achieve propulsion at very small scales. So, they're not only trying to model    
38:39    
sort of this chemotactic behavior and the conditions for chemotaxis the mechanism, but they're also trying to    
38:45    
model this sort of propulsion. How do you achieve propulsion? And so, that's    
38:50    
how they in their this model system, they're able to do that as well.    
38:56    
When placed in chemical gradients of the respective substrate, enzyme encapsulating vesicles show a    
39:02    
chemotactic component towards the substrate source, confirming the ability to autonomously propel.    
39:09    
Thus, the confinement of chemical reactions and nanometric volumes was able to generate energy sufficient to be    
39:16    
transformed into autonomous motion. So this is a proof of concept and it    
39:21    
demonstrates that a cell-like vesicle equipped with confined active molecules and a transmembrane protein can    
39:28    
effectively overcome brownie in motion and be chemotactic. So we don't want brownie in motion where it's moving    
39:34    
around the source kind of in that way that we saw. You know it's it's because    
39:39    
it's kind of trying to find the next highest concentration of the chemical.    
39:44    
It's going to move around sort of in a a brownie in motion towards the source, but we don't want brownie in motion    
39:50    
where it's just kind of orbiting the source and just kind of, you know, totally lost in space.    
39:58    
Okay, so these results are promising from a biochemical point of view because the elements we studied are ubiquitously    
40:04    
present in the structure of a large majority of cells. For this reason, we are convinced that understanding in more    
40:10    
detail the behavior of our system will significantly improve the comprehension of complex biological phenomena such as    
40:18    
vesicle transport disclosing mechanisms that are not fully understood.    
40:23    
So that is that paper. Um so let's go to the third one    
40:30    
and I'm not going to get deeply into this uh but I did want to bring this up in the same context as these other    
40:35    
papers. So this paper is uh from the archive. Uh this is from last year. So it might    
40:42    
be published somewhere by now. But this is thermodynamic space of chemical reaction networks.    
40:49    
So this describes a chemical reaction network and then the accompanying thermodynamic space. The abstract reads    
40:56    
living systems are usually maintained out of equilibrium and exhibit complex dynamical behavior. So if we're talking    
41:02    
about vesicles, you know, these are systems that are equilibrium systems. We can    
41:09    
create them in different ways that are very simple and we can understand their    
41:14    
outputs and it's it's pretty good. Um but some in more complex cells like the    
41:21    
cells that we observe in living systems, bacterial cells, archal cells,    
41:26    
especially ukareotic cells, these systems are maintained out of equilibrium. That means that they uh    
41:33    
often exhibit out of equilibrium behavior and you know so we can't use equilibrium    
41:40    
models to really understand what they're doing. We need to understand you know they exhibit these kind of complex    
41:46    
dynamical behaviors behaviors over time that we need a different model for.    
41:53    
Uh the external energy supply often comes from chemical fluxes that can keep    
41:58    
some species concentrations constant. So this is in chemistry where we have    
42:03    
different types of chemical species and they have to be sort of you know they're either in equilibrium or often more    
42:09    
often than not they are going to be out of equilibrium but nevertheless you need    
42:14    
to have constant concentrations of things to have reactions.    
42:20    
Furthermore the properties of the underlying chemical reaction networks or CRNs. So I talked about GRNs which are    
42:27    
genetic regulatory networks. These are chemical reaction networks or CRNs and they operate in a similar way.    
42:34    
Basically, they're connected by, you know, what chemical reactions are happening, which    
42:40    
ones do, which chemical reactions other chemical reactions enable and so forth.    
42:46    
Um, I'm not as familiar with those as I am with GRNs, but uh as a caveat here.    
42:51    
Um so the properties under of the underlying chemical reaction networks are also instrumental in establishing    
42:59    
robust biological function. Hence capturing the emerging complexity    
43:05    
of linear systems and the role of their non-equilibrium nature is fundamental to    
43:10    
uncover constraints and properties of the CRN's underpinning their functions.    
43:17    
In particular, while kinetics play a key role in shaping detailed dynamical phenomena, the range of operations of    
43:23    
any CRN must be fundamentally constrained by thermodynamics    
43:28    
as they necessarily operate within a given energy. So we need to have this sort of set of    
43:35    
thermodynamic constraints in our model. Um, and so that's that's what they're talking about here. Here we derive a    
43:42    
universal thermodynamic upper and lower bound for the accessible space of species concentrations in a generic    
43:50    
helical reaction. So what they're doing is they're basically creating this kind of model    
43:55    
where you have uh    
44:00    
basically this uh this possibility space and they're trying to figure out you    
44:06    
know what spaces are accessible and inaccessible given the thermodynamic    
44:12    
limitations of the system that we're talking. So all we need is energy. The more    
44:18    
energy we have the more of that space we can access. The less energy we have available, the less of that space we can    
44:24    
access. Uh the resulting region determines the    
44:30    
thermodynamic space of the chemical reaction that we're a concept we    
44:35    
introduce in this. And so this is kind of like if you think about like a    
44:40    
combinatorial system where you have a lot of different things interacting and you have so many different combinations    
44:47    
and you can use a mathematical model to describe that space. That space isn't    
44:52    
limitless. Sometimes it's constrained by different things. It's constrained by plausible combinations of things. It's    
44:59    
constrained sometimes by thermodynamics. H sometimes it's constrained by the number of steps you can take. uh and so    
45:06    
that gives you this plausible space of of things in that larger space. And so    
45:12    
that's kind of how they're thinking about this. Uh moreover, we obtain similar bounds    
45:19    
also for the affinities shedding light on how global thermodynamic properties can limit non local non-equilibrium    
45:26    
quantities. We illustrate our results in two paradigmatic examples.    
45:32    
The first is the schlugal model for bstability. Um and then the second is a minimal self    
45:39    
assembly process. So by stability is where you have a system where there two stable states and    
45:47    
you trans you transition between those two stable states. So if you have like    
45:53    
a, you know, if you're in one stable state, you might operate in that stable state for a while until you hit a    
46:00    
critical point and then you transition into the other state and you go back and    
46:06    
forth between those two states. You stay in that stable state for a while and then there's some point at which you transition to the other state.    
46:14    
There are a lot of systems that are bstable. Um sometimes they're onoff switches. sometimes they transition    
46:20    
between two states of behavior and and the like and then of course    
46:25    
minimal self assembly is where we want to find the minimal conditions for self assembly.    
46:31    
What are the thermodynamic constraints of that process? So both of these cases demonstrate how    
46:37    
the onset of complex behaviors is intimately tangled at the presence of non-equilibrium drive.    
46:44    
Uh in summary, our work unveils the exact form of the accessible space in which a chemical reaction network must    
46:51    
work as a function of its energy budget shedding light on the non-equilibrium    
46:57    
origin of a variety of phenomena from amplification to pattern formation.    
47:03    
Ultimately, by providing a general tool for analyzing chemical reaction networks, the presented framework con uh    
47:09    
constitutes a stepping stone to deepen our ability to predict complex autoequilibrium behaviors and design    
47:17    
artificial chemical reaction systems. So, this is uh good stuff. A lot of    
47:23    
complexity theory here, a lot of uh like bioysics.    
47:29    
Um and so they just make the point that living systems operate far from equilibrium consuming energy to maintain    
47:37    
organized states against the tendency towards increasing entropy. So this is a    
47:43    
interesting point that entropy usually acts to degrade a lot of processes. So    
47:49    
when you're talking about like uh like a minimal chemical system, you're talking    
47:56    
about a system that is probably constrained quite heavily by entropy.    
48:03    
Whereas living systems they don't defy entropy but they do thing they build a    
48:08    
lot of complexity in spite of entropy. So to do that they have to operate far from equilibrium.    
48:15    
Um they have to consume energy in different ways and they have to uh maintain these organized states. And a    
48:22    
lot of this is very interesting because we often think of an entropy and thermodynamic    
48:30    
constraints in an equilibrium sense or in a closed system sense. So it's it's    
48:36    
you know cells living systems are open systems meaning that you don't close off    
48:42    
or you don't limit the amount of input energy. They're getting input energy from a lot of places. And so there's a    
48:48    
different set of rules, you know, for open systems than there are for closed systems.    
48:55    
Uh chemical reaction networks or CRNs capture many of these biochemical processes, including gene regulation,    
49:02    
metabolism, and cellular information processing. To analyze these complex systems,    
49:08    
chemical reaction network theory had been has been developed, providing a powerful framework for characterizing    
49:14    
CRNs, revealing how complex behaviors emerge or underlying molecular    
49:19    
interactions. And so, um, the complexity manifests in various forms including what they call    
49:26    
non-equilibrium stationary states, multistarity,    
49:31    
chaos, and oscillations. So this is these are the different ways in which you can get u different complexity    
49:39    
related behaviors. Um none of these are you know reliant on the sort of equilibrium model.    
49:47    
The wide range of possibilities is instrumental for establishing robust biological functions together with the    
49:53    
necessity of continuously harvesting dissipating energy into the environment.    
49:58    
So they need to get energy from a lot of places. They need to move energy around    
50:04    
different processes and there's a wide variety of processes robust biological    
50:10    
functions that need to be established in a living cell. And so these non-equilibrium conditions play a role    
50:18    
in this. Um so they can amplify the abundance of a desired biochemical state, trigger the    
50:25    
onset of complex dynamics and regulate the emergence of large scale structures.    
50:31    
And so they kind of get into this uh landscape or possibility model where    
50:36    
they model all the possible states and then they kind of constrain it given the amount of energy coming in. They do the    
50:43    
uh math here. They they provide some calculation of the different chemical    
50:50    
species in the chemical reaction network. Um    
50:55    
and so they work out the thermodynamics and geometry of these networks in this section.    
51:02    
And then they talk about the universal thermodynamic bounds for chemical reaction networks. So we have these    
51:08    
thermodynamic accessible regions.    
51:14    
We have this thermodynamic space that emerges. So these are the accessible regions for species concentrations.    
51:23    
And then they connect this to previous results. So this math just doesn't exist as this model actually connects to    
51:31    
what people are doing in the field and what's going on in the real world.    
51:36    
So this shows the shogal model which they talk about in the abstract. This is the thermodynamic space of the shoulder    
51:43    
model. So this is the bstability model that we talked about where you have    
51:48    
stable points and then unstable points. So your stable states are A and B. These    
51:53    
are two cheatic external species. Uh and then you have this system. I guess this    
52:00    
is a hyperraph model. So you have um    
52:06    
this these two chemical species. You have this concentration uh X and then when you get to a certain    
52:13    
concentration you go from A to B because you hit this unstable region of    
52:18    
concentration you go into B. And then the same thing happens at B. B going to A and so you can see actually I think    
52:25    
this is a one-weight reaction. So this is like A is the stable state here and the concentration is here. This is the    
52:33    
sort of the diff uh differential of that function and then you hit this unstable    
52:39    
point and then you transition quickly to the other state B and then that exists in a stable state.    
52:46    
Uh for B you have this uh they call an EFM of the Scholga model which in the in    
52:53    
which the internal species X is created from the environment which is in green    
52:59    
here and then degraded into it respectively through reactions one and two. So we have these chemical    
53:04    
reactions. This is chemical reaction one. This is chemical reaction two. In    
53:09    
in a it goes it enables this move to an unstable state. then also enables a move    
53:16    
back to a stable state. In B we have this uh we have the environment having    
53:22    
an effect on this internal chemical species and then these two reactions    
53:28    
either a direct path or an indirect path that transform this and we get this nonlinear function here to show.    
53:38    
Okay. Um so then they kind of go through the schol and the mathematics of it.    
53:43    
This is the reaction hyperraph with three internal species, two external species F and W which are in the green    
53:51    
and then a chemical probe which is a dashed red which is on the outside here.    
53:56    
Um and then for B the elementary flux model or EFM including the chemical    
54:02    
probe with vector representation E hat. So we have this represented in this way.    
54:10    
The sequence of reactions from the EFM inverting species from left to right of the probe. Thermodynamics for D. This is    
54:17    
the thermodynamic space here which is this plane on this threedimensional    
54:23    
space. And then the con conservation laws which are this triangular plane on the space and there's this intersection    
54:30    
of the yellow and the green which is the thermodynamic space given the    
54:35    
conservation laws. That's where your steady state concentrations. So the idea is you run these networks    
54:42    
and you show kind of what the thermodynamic space is. You use the conservation laws to constrain that    
54:49    
thermodynamic space and then you get this this uh surface or this manifold of    
54:56    
uh the possible steady state concentrations for these species F and W. Then they talk about self assembly    
55:05    
and the mathematics behind that. So the discussion uh basically concludes that    
55:12    
we have derived funal thermodynamic fundamental thermodynamic constraints on generic chemical reaction networks at    
55:19    
stationerity introducing the novel concept of thermodynamic space to describe the    
55:25    
feasible range of species chemical species concentrations compatible with the systems energy budget. Um our    
55:33    
approach is based on chemical reaction network hypograph geometry and utilizes the novel novel chemical probe technique    
55:40    
to study chemical species that are directly linked by an existing reaction. So it ex significantly extends and    
55:48    
generalizes previous findings on linear and catalytic networks. Um so there's    
55:53    
this area of pseudo unimolecular chemical reaction networks to arbitrary    
55:59    
network topologies and that's one example these kind of linear catalytic    
56:05    
networks. This generation is crucial for applications in complex multiocular    
56:10    
chemical reaction networks such as multi-stationary biochemical networks    
56:16    
and self assembly processes which are widespread living systems. but their    
56:21    
study has fallen short of a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis and that's what they've introduced here. So    
56:27    
that's all I have on those papers. I wanted to present those as a group because I think it kind of gets at some    
56:33    
of these things we've been talking about thoroughly life but also with these kind of models of um biologic or biohysical    
56:41    
space. How do we represent all the possible outcomes of a complex system?    
56:47    
And then how do we evaluate that? Comments or questions? Um how does that fit in with um organels    
56:55    
in a cell? because it it's some sort of a a similar process from what I'm seeing    
57:04    
like the the organels develop kind of on their    
57:10    
own um within a cell like there    
57:15    
some sort of a separation occurs in inside a cell    
57:22    
um due to the chemical nature of Um    
57:28    
well of the of the chemicals inside um they they separate into organels.    
57:36    
Yeah. I'm not sure. I don't know if there are any papers. I might try to find a paper for next week on that.    
57:41    
Um yeah, I have some. Oh, okay. You do? All right. Well, them for you.    
57:47    
All right. Yeah, because I'm not sure what the answer to that is. Um,    
57:54    
yeah, I'm not I'm not familiar with the development of organels, but it sounds like you do, so we'll check it out.    
58:03    
Well, I was interested in mitochondria. Yeah. Yeah, mitochondria are interesting in that respect.    
58:09    
Yeah. I don't know. I haven't really read them. I just collected the papers. Yeah. Yeah.    
58:20    
All right. Thank you. Any other comments or questions?    
58:30    
Did we lose them? Okay. Uh    
58:40    
are those synthetic cells are they and I I know cytoplasm but like are are there    
58:46    
are they able to produce more of their cytoplasms or as they divide are they    
58:51    
continually getting smaller and smallobic out exterior and hydrophilic interior uh    
58:59    
that they mentioned? Yeah,    
59:04    
they divide. Are they getting smaller and smaller or they actually like reproduce them if that makes sense?    
59:11    
Yeah. Yeah. Like in a lot of cells, you know, they'll get smaller and smaller as they    
59:17    
divide or they divide into half the size and then they might grow like, you know, as newly reproduced cells. In uh    
59:25    
vesicles, I guess it depends on how they set up the system. So a lot of vesicles have a deterministic size and then they    
59:33    
re you know sometimes they're doing things like shedding ails and they're    
59:38    
kind of creating a new new vesicle at a critical size. Sometimes it's a fixed    
59:45    
size. I'm not really familiar with the ways you could do this. I mean, there are probably a lot of techniques that    
59:50    
you can use to sort of, you know, replicate what goes on in biology, which is the point, but yeah, I don't know.    
59:59    
Okay. Thank you. Also, um, and I'll put the link in in the chat. Um, if you have    
1:00:05    
Springer access, there is a book on CRN's that that you can get for free.    
1:00:10    
Oh, great. Yeah. Thank you. So, I imagine most of us here have some sort of institutional access. Before we    
1:00:17    
go, are there any updates that people want to give? Uh I don't know if seen had an update or    
1:00:22    
Sure. Sure. Yeah, no problem. Uh okay. So, um a bunch of different    
1:00:29    
projects. The uh C2 projects. I I think I might have mentioned this before, but I'll just go over it again because it's    
1:00:35    
I don't know who is here. I don't know. Um yeah. So    
1:00:41    
we've made really really tremendous progress over the past couple weeks on um the RBYRCT. So that's the rayby ray    
1:00:48    
computer tomography project to reproduce images as uh to reproduce images using    
1:00:55    
CT technology and show that the combination of the mart algorithm which    
1:01:00    
dick first proposed back in the 70s the multiple operating reconstructor technique the mart algorithm could    
1:01:07    
reconstruct images um with very very very little information and um all of    
1:01:13    
this is based off of CT approaches Um, excuse me, excuse me. With our with our    
1:01:19    
new setup in apparatus showing that we can um that that we can um excuse me uh    
1:01:26    
that we can steer hexrays electronically on a very very very fine tune precise level. I finally the gist for this    
1:01:32    
update is that I finally got the MR algorithm working with the Astro toolbox. The astro toolbox is the um set    
1:01:39    
of um photon scattering light techn light light light optics sort of programming software scripts that we're    
1:01:46    
supposed to be using. Okay, previously we tried implementing things from basic Python mat lab and stuff from the ground    
1:01:52    
up which may have worked but um you know to actually show that this is feasible and presentable we need to be able to    
1:01:57    
use what Muhammad Al Muhammad Majad Alf so he's a computer scientist over in UK    
1:02:02    
what he himself had recommended. Yep. So that's the uh the biggest update on that    
1:02:08    
side of things. Um in terms of the work between me and Zik uh me and Zick and    
1:02:13    
Savina with Savina's group. So that's on the peptide the peptide the peptide um    
1:02:20    
excuse me that's that's on the uh the peptide project. We are studying vesicle    
1:02:27    
formation with peptides across lipidic membranes to see how they may have come about. And that was kind of in reference to the paper that Bradley just mentioned    
1:02:34    
where the uh growth and reorgation of fully abiotic artificial and synthetic cells. That paper which supposedly some    
1:02:41    
people would call the the most important paper of 2025 which was that's a pretty    
1:02:46    
that's a that's a pretty bold one. And um that's a that's a pretty bold one.    
1:02:51    
But um the okay we we're do we're writing a bunch    
1:02:57    
of different papers doing simulations based off empirical data. Um, notwithstanding like the uh the book The    
1:03:04    
Laws of the Game, which I just got through the mail recently. So, I'm reading through that one. But at at it root, we are talking about um imagining    
1:03:11    
lipid membranes also as sort of a chessboard where you have L membranes and D    
1:03:18    
L and D membrane peptides from mixed LD peptides. And the basic the basic    
1:03:24    
question is how do peptide membranes form? Okay. Can you show based off entropy, based off thermodynamics, based    
1:03:30    
off the simulations from empirical results between computational data approaches that the actual membr me    
1:03:36    
membranes of cells are able to reasonably visibly form based off the empirical information and from the    
1:03:43    
origin of life in and of itself. Um so really really really exciting stuff and this just affects basically more or less    
1:03:49    
every different area you can come across. And um yeah yeah yeah excuse me.    
1:03:56    
Um, in other news, I I recently learned, speaking of evolutionary approaches to    
1:04:03    
the origins of life and things, I recently learned    
1:04:08    
I recently learned that whales descended from land land mammals. And that was really surprising because I I was for    
1:04:15    
whatever reason under the impression that life went from one direction, from sea to the land. And I totally forgot    
1:04:20    
about that. That there are aquatic creatures, fully aquatic creatures, which also descended from land animals themselves. which sort of went back into    
1:04:27    
the water and that's that's pretty surprising. So whales are more closely related to like horses and wolves and    
1:04:33    
yeah to the best of of my understanding any any mammal that is in the sea went    
1:04:39    
what went from land to sea although I I could be wrong about that. No, no, no. I    
1:04:45    
I thought I thought it was typically uh unidirectional in one direction. Like anything that is walking on land and    
1:04:51    
spends more or less all of its life on land originally started out 100% completely aquatic underwater, you know.    
1:04:59    
But then then I realized things like whales, nope. Nope. They went the other direction. Yeah. It's based off the the    
1:05:06    
vestibular fins, the bony structure in their vestibular fins matches much more closely the structure of horses. And not    
1:05:13    
necessarily saying modern day horses for whatever reason started jumping back in the water for no reason, but more so the    
1:05:19    
common ancestor between horses and whales shows them much more closely uh in that um much more closely linked in    
1:05:26    
that direction too. So yeah, that's just something interesting too. So    
1:05:31    
yeah, that's good. Okay. Um I think that's it for today.    
1:05:37    
Thanks for the update, Usain. I'll post the papers effective the the Astro toolbox. So    
1:05:43    
that's what we use for the CC computer tomography approaches. It has taken me four months to get it running.    
1:05:49    
Wow. To get it right to get to get the algorithm coded and coded properly. Not just based off technical codes and    
1:05:55    
errors and issues and things but it it it may seem just like very very straightforward but the the toolboxes    
1:06:02    
they themselves have their own quirks and idiosyncrasies you have to you have to plow through. And even Muhammad himself where he had been using Astra    
1:06:08    
for a long time, he he still spent quite a bit of time getting it to work. So yeah, one one thing for me on a on a daily    
1:06:14    
basis when it comes to just like like technical things and complicated stuff,    
1:06:20    
it can be difficult to really sit down and get focused on the precise errors about what's going wrong. Many times    
1:06:26    
it's just so useful for us academics to kind of just like like blackbox sit and    
1:06:31    
say whatever happens happens. Yeah. when um you know because if we c if we couldn't show that the Astro    
1:06:36    
toolbox could be used to show the MAR algorithm could reconstruct images then we had no basis there's no way any    
1:06:42    
journal would publish that you know so well that's good yeah all right thank    
1:06:50    
you all right uh that's it for today I'll put the papers up on the YouTube in    
1:06:56    
the YouTube description or in the probably in the Slack as well and uh thank you see you next    
1:07:04    
Five.
