So, welcome to the Divore meeting for today. Uh, since we didn't meet last week, today I wanted to give an update   
0:07   
on the final submissions for Google Summer code. Uh, our two scholars Giada   
0:14   
Diane and Lebu and then I wanted to go over a few papers that are in our reading queue. So the first thing I want   
0:21   
to talk about today is congratulations to our Google Summer of Code scholars   
0:27   
for this summer Gadrath Gian and Lewis Baru and they've um completed their   
0:33   
projects and committed them successfully to the DVO graph repository   
0:39   
in DVOR. So this is uh our DVLearn organization here. We've been working on   
0:45   
this for the past seven or eight years now. uh the software for   
0:51   
analyzing microscopy images, analyzing other types of developmental data and   
0:58   
then developing algorithms, deep learning algorithms and more recently uh   
1:03   
graph neural networks to analyze those data and turn them into visualizations   
1:10   
and theoretical insights. Uh GIA and Leith have been contributing to DVOGraph.   
1:16   
This is the D.VO graph repository. Uh the contributor section needs to be updated to reflect the recent   
1:24   
gains in in the content. Uh the first one is DVOG. This is the one that   
1:30   
Jadratha worked on this summer. This is stand devot stands for developmental   
1:36   
temporal graph networks. So these are temporal graph networks. a subset of   
1:42   
GNN's where you look at the time dependency of different network   
1:49   
topologies and how they change over time. And so this was the project where he was using a secondary data set to   
1:57   
calibrate these graphs and to build visualizations. So he got a lot of work done this   
2:02   
summer. There's a lot of code in this repository. Um you have of course the data set that   
2:08   
he used. He has the cell line edge data set, a conneto data set and then some   
2:14   
sample data here. So this is the relationship between a parent cell and two daughter cells. Uh the birth time   
2:21   
given in minutes of development, the position of the parent given in XYZ   
2:26   
coordinates and then there's this mapping between the parent cell and the daughter cell. So you can follow this   
2:31   
through the graph. So this developmental lineage tree is growing through time.   
2:37   
it's growing and branching downward and then of course you have the conneto   
2:43   
data set which is the conneto cells. So he used the conneto uh data from   
2:50   
whitleet 2021. Whitleet 2021 data set is a synaptic   
2:56   
data sets what looks at the synaptic connections between cells or the chemical connections between cells and   
3:04   
those data are available for four stages of laral development as well as the adult. So he's actually able to get   
3:11   
developmental uh data for sea elegance. Uh so you're not just dealing with more   
3:17   
or less a static adult conneto but the larval conneto as well. So this developmental data set involves eight   
3:24   
developmental time points and in our meetings from this summer uh JA was showing some of the visualizations of   
3:31   
these different graphs. And so he I don't know if he quite got to a point where he synthesized   
3:38   
all of these developmental graphs into one visualization, but um definitely   
3:44   
that's maybe uh a followup part of the project. So the idea of these projects   
3:49   
is just to get as far as you can over the allotted course of time. So there many things that probably can be done   
3:56   
with these data and these these visualizations in the code. So looks like if we walk through this there's if   
4:02   
you go through uh he has everything in um collab notebook so you can run them   
4:08   
from the notebooks. If you clone the repository you should be able to run the notebooks without too much problem. The   
4:14   
first point is the cell division analysis. So you start off there. Then you have the conneto development   
4:20   
analysis. Everything should be all the data should be included in the CSV files.   
4:25   
Then you complete your analysis pipeline. So this will download conneto data sets, process them into temporal   
4:32   
graphs, perform the network analysis, generate comprehensive visualizations   
4:37   
and create interactive animations.   
4:47   
So this is a lineage data set. We have the parent cell, the daughter cells as we saw before on the position with the   
4:54   
birth time   
5:01   
and then we have the conneto data sets and we have eight conneto data sets.   
5:07   
And so if we take a look at the data we see that there's this presinaptic cell, this post synaptic cell. So remember   
5:13   
we're talking about the mature neurons in the conneto. So we have a different nomenclature than we did for the   
5:20   
developmental cells. We have ADAO and ADAR which are ADA left and ADA right.   
5:27   
So those are right left pairs. So there's a presinaptic left partner and a   
5:32   
post synaptic right partner which suggest the directionality. You actually have in this uh conneto you   
5:40   
have both electrical and chemical synapses. So it actually includes electrical synapses as well and so then   
5:47   
this just number is just the type of synapse. So if we have all these we can   
5:53   
actually look at the chemical synapses. We can also look at the electrical connections and we can get a sense of   
5:59   
what that connect looks like. But we have these data over laral development.   
6:05   
So these connections are going to change across laral development. And then   
6:10   
within this data set, they're also counts. If you go through and analyze it, they're counts of synapses per pair.   
6:19   
And so these are the notebooks   
6:28   
and just look at some of the visualizations. This is the division pattern analysis.   
6:33   
So they ran a nice analysis on this.   
6:39   
He ran a generation analysis which is here. So we have number of box plots and scatter plots.   
6:48   
He has the time progression analysis. So he has these   
6:53   
point clouds that show the position of cells and the x and y coordinates.   
7:00   
And then for the conneto analysis specifically we have this evolution of connection types over development with   
7:07   
electrical synapses and chemical synapses. So the majority of these in the data set are chemical synapses.   
7:21   
Then he has these network growth metrics and this just show the growth of the network over time.   
7:44   
Then finally this is the network evolution visualization. So this just shows these networks as they change over   
7:51   
time. So it was able to show kind of this change over time for the eight   
7:56   
different topologies and how those connections change. So if I go over it   
8:02   
again, you can see that it changes over time   
8:07   
as the network evolves. And so there's a lot of information to   
8:13   
be gained out of these networks and how they change over time. uh you gain statistical information but there's   
8:19   
probably also a lot of topological information that we can extract as well. So congratulations to Giadroth on a job   
8:26   
well done on this DVOG project. Now Aith did the NDP HNN project   
8:35   
which stands for uh the NDP is this neural developmental programs   
8:41   
and then HNN is hyperraph neural networks. So the neural developmental programs approach we used this uh last   
8:48   
summer. Um we we would develop that to the point where you know we could   
8:54   
actually apply it to C elegance and then way picked up that and carry it forward   
9:00   
to the work he's doing now with hyperraph neural networks. So basically the two projects last summer the   
9:06   
hyperraphs and neural developmental programs were combined with this project.   
9:13   
So Vanchawi did the work on neural developmental programs.   
9:18   
So thanks to her work, you know, he's able to move this forward. So um this is   
9:25   
his repository. Looks like you can set the environment   
9:31   
up. You can clone the repository. Set the environment up.   
9:38   
You have to specify your data format. This is the way he has the data set up.   
9:43   
So he he has uh different parameters like parent cell, birth time and then   
9:50   
there are these different parameters that are passed in and there a certain data type and then it gives notes on   
9:56   
that. So this is the documentation here for a lot of you know basically the idea   
10:02   
is we're going to have different data sets that we can import here and use them as needed.   
10:09   
So, it gives instructions on how to run things and then troubleshooting as well.   
10:54   
So the way uh Lewis has put this into the   
10:59   
GitHub repository uh he has different py files and so he doesn't have the net notebooks but he   
11:06   
has the py files and you can run this in an environment or compile it if you   
11:11   
want. So he has the code for generating hyper edges.   
11:17   
He has the code for loss function.   
11:25   
He has the code for the H&N model.   
11:32   
And then he has the code for visualizing the outputs in UAP or K means cluster.   
11:41   
So if you're interested in knowing more about his project, uh he's given a number of different uh presentations on   
11:47   
it over the course of the summer in the Diva War meeting. So I refer you to those meetings to see how some of this   
11:54   
code works. Congratulations to on a job well done and good luck with both   
12:03   
scholars in the future. So the first paper for today is this paper the regulatory landscapes of   
12:10   
neuroid development in sea elegance. And so this is   
12:17   
um a little bit different way of thinking about the conneto. The abstract reads neuronal   
12:23   
communication requires precise connectivity of murite projections   
12:30   
and an examples are axons and dendrites. developing neurites express cell surface   
12:36   
receptors that interpret extracellular cues to enable correct guidance towards   
12:44   
connection with target cells. So this is talking about how when you have your   
12:50   
lineage tree, those cells, some of those cells eventually become neurons.   
12:57   
And in the process of becoming neurons, they have to connect to other neurons. And so neurites are these projections or   
13:04   
these things that come out of the cells as they're differentiating and connecting that guide the connections   
13:11   
the axonal connections to other cells. So axonal connections of course enable   
13:17   
these chemical connections that we talked about in quickly data set and   
13:23   
enable the connectivity of the conneto. So we have the electrical conneto which   
13:29   
are these gap junctions where the cells come into contact and then you have   
13:34   
these projections these more formal axonal connections or these axonal   
13:41   
projections that allow for these synaptic connections to be made and so   
13:46   
that's what they're looking at here. Um so developing neurites express cell surface receptors that interpret   
13:53   
extracellular cues. So you have this gradient that exists within the   
13:58   
developing nervous system that guides these connections towards the correct partner. As you noticed from the data   
14:06   
set, there are certain cells that are connected with other cells. And those cells don't those connections don't   
14:13   
radically change across different organisms. When you have plasticity,   
14:19   
there are specific connections made that are functional. And so you have the   
14:24   
ability to trace circuits within the CL events conneto. And part of that is due   
14:29   
to this uh system of axonal guidance   
14:35   
that axons can make to the correct partner in the nervous system, make that   
14:41   
connection and complete that circuit. So that's what they're talking about   
14:47   
here. And this is a a little bit different view on the conneto because it fills in the gaps of our developmental   
14:53   
conneto. So one thing we have of course is the lineage tree. Another part is   
14:59   
this ability to look at the plasticity both chemical and electrical synapses.   
15:06   
And then the third part then is how do you get this structure form from this basically differentiating cells. And   
15:14   
that's what we're doing. Spaciotemporal regulation of neuroi guidance molecule expression by transcription factors is   
15:21   
critical for nervous system development and function. So we have this uh we have of course   
15:28   
this set of transcription factors that are activated in different cells and this is spatiotemporally   
15:35   
distinct. So a neuron or a developing neuron in one part of the nervous system   
15:42   
is going to have a different set of cues than a cell in another part of developing nervous system. And this   
15:48   
gradient also exists in spatiotemporal uh space or spatiotemporal   
15:55   
spatiotemporal context where you can have this gradient between two cells.   
16:04   
The neurites know how to guide the axon to the proper target and can distinguish   
16:09   
between targets. If you notice from the data set, at least in C elegance, these   
16:15   
cells are generally in a certain place in the anatomy. And so that's kind of   
16:22   
playing into this whole model. Here we review how neurite development is regulated by transcription factors in   
16:29   
the C elegance nervous system. By collecting publicly available transcryto   
16:34   
and chip sequencing data will reveal gene expression dynamics during neurotic development. And so chip sequencing   
16:42   
allows us to look at uh epigenetic phenomena, how genes are expressed.   
16:49   
And then of course we have our transcriptto data which is actually a measure of mRNA   
16:57   
in like a certain volume of tissue. This provides insight into   
17:03   
transcriptional mechanisms governing construction of the nervous system architecture. So this introduction just   
17:10   
talks about sort of how animal nervous systems have developed to enable the   
17:15   
transmission of information over long distances. information transfer between neurons   
17:21   
relies on neurite projections called axons and dendrites. So axons and   
17:26   
dendrites axons are going out from a cell. Dendrites are coming into a cell   
17:32   
and they allow for information processing to occur and so the the   
17:38   
neurites are basically these projections from the cell body itself.   
17:43   
Direct neurite development is therefore critical for efficient signal transduction between neurons within a   
17:49   
neural circuit. During development, neurites are guided to their targets by   
17:55   
attractive and repulsive cues from surrounding cells and tissues and the   
18:00   
extracellular matrix. So the extracellular matrix is the space between cells uh where the cells are   
18:07   
migrating within and this is where these gradients are set up. This is where these projections are being made and   
18:14   
this is allowing for this sort of connectivity and you have these basic what we call   
18:19   
taxes. So we see taxes at the organismal level in C elegance but we also see   
18:25   
these taxes at the intracellular level uh in C elegance. And this is an example   
18:32   
of a taxis where these neurites are sort of guiding along a gradient. they're   
18:39   
being repulsed and attracted to certain chemicals, certain chemical concentrations, and it leads them to the   
18:45   
proper target. Otherwise, in an environment where they didn't have those cues, they would just kind of branch off   
18:52   
at random, and connectivity would just not be possible. You might get some   
18:58   
connections by chance, but most of the development of a coherent conneto would   
19:03   
not occur. And so this whole idea of neuro guidance, we need to identify   
19:08   
lians and receptors. So why are we interested in gene expression? Well, a lot of neuron   
19:15   
subtypes, especially within C elegance where they're deterministically   
19:21   
where they're determined deterministically have specific neurite projection   
19:27   
patterns that are guided by distinct gene expression programs. So we know kind of that cells are going to in a   
19:34   
certain place and the gene expression programs are activated at a certain point in development.   
19:40   
Um and of course neuroite development requires precisely controlled spatial temporal expression of these factors.   
19:48   
And so transcription factors are key regulators of gene expression that control multiple processes of neuronal   
19:55   
development including polarization, migration and guidance of the neurite   
20:01   
projections. So we need to a number of things need to happen in order for this   
20:06   
process to be uh accurate and so those are all set up by transcription factors.   
20:14   
Transcription factors regulate neurite development by controlling signaling cell adhesion and junction molecules as   
20:21   
well as cytokeleton modifiers. So transcription factors uh really do play   
20:28   
a key role in regulating neuro development and coordinated expression in time and space. Transcription factors   
20:35   
can regulate neuro development cell autonomously or regulate the expression of cues and receptors from surrounding   
20:42   
tissues. The complexity and dynamic nature of the nervous system makes invivo analysis regulatory mechanisms   
20:51   
governing neuro development challenging. So we don't really have a good way to   
20:58   
sort of get a a a precise measurement of these transcription factors. A lot of   
21:04   
times they act combinatorically. So they're developing this means to to sort of get at this signaling this   
21:12   
festival of signaling would say. So it's hard to get a good account of the sort   
21:18   
of the combinatorial nature of this transcription factor uh expression. these different programs.   
21:25   
So that's what they're trying to do in this paper for sea elegance because sea elegance is a relatively simple model.   
21:32   
So animal models have been used to study neurite development including mouse, rat, zebra fish, fruitfly and sea   
21:40   
elegance. This is prior work on neurite development itself. What they're doing is they're developing   
21:48   
uh this sort of map for the entire conneto. So here we review all published neuride   
21:54   
development related transcription factors in C elements. We've also collected and integrated bulk and single   
22:00   
cell transcriptto data to extract expression patterns of lians receptors   
22:06   
and transcription factors involved in neuron development. So they have the transcription factor data which is a   
22:12   
measurement of the RNA the mRNA involved in this process. So you measure the   
22:18   
abundance of the mRNA, you can get a fix on how strongly a transcription factor   
22:25   
is expressed in a certain cell in a certain part of the nervous system.   
22:32   
Then they use chipsseek data. So chipsseek data is a way to measure um   
22:37   
epigenetic phenomena. So they're looking at um how uh transcription factors bind   
22:44   
upstream of genes encoding different lians and receptors involved in neuro   
22:50   
development. So they actually look at how these genes are regulated with the chipsseek data and then the abundance of   
22:56   
mRNA in the transcription factor data. So you can get a sense of how these are   
23:02   
being regulated by other genes and then how they're regulated locally in the   
23:08   
conneto. And so they give a little overview of   
23:14   
the neuronal wiring system. So neurites are neuronal projections that transmit   
23:19   
information within the nervous system and to non-nuronal cells and tissues.   
23:24   
Neurites are classified as axons and dendrites. that transfer information from and to   
23:30   
the cell body. In most vertebrates, axons are insulated by a protected milin   
23:36   
sheath that enables rapid electrical conductance. Whereas some animals such   
23:41   
as sea elegant lack such structures. So sea elegance doesn't have this myelin   
23:46   
sheath like in other vertebrates. Um, depending on the neuron type,   
23:52   
dendrites may be a single projection or highly arborized to receive information from multiple neurons.   
24:00   
Neurites directly transmit information to target cells through synapses that release specific neurotransmitters or   
24:07   
through electrical junctions that allow ion flow. This these are our chemical and electrical connections respectively.   
24:15   
And so neuroite development is composed of projection, polarization, extension of neurites that are controlled by   
24:22   
dedicated signaling pathways and cytokeleletal rearrangement.   
24:27   
And so there are a bunch of reviews on neuro developmental processes and you know the mechanics and the   
24:34   
anatomy of this uh mechanisms governing axon guidance   
24:39   
and segans have also been reviewed by Chisum and colleagues and this is this paper from 2016 which is here. This is   
24:49   
uh the genetics of axon guidance and axon regeneration in sea elegance in the   
24:55   
journal genetics. So the figure one is this architecture of the C elegance   
25:00   
nervous system. So they show this um this is uh the aid neuron. This is the   
25:07   
fairings. This is the nerve ring. So basically they show the schematic of the adult celegans from aphrodite   
25:15   
and they show these major axodendritic processes. So you have the denderites   
25:21   
coming in from the sides of the organism bringing in information from the   
25:27   
sensory cells. You have this midline here. It's bringing   
25:33   
information up into the central nervous system here. So you can see all of these different structures   
25:40   
that are involved in exodendic processes. And so you can see that there's there are these projections that   
25:47   
are needed throughout the body of C elegance to bring information to different parts of other parts of the   
25:53   
body including the central nervous system. So you can see where you need to have this process active across the   
26:00   
organism throughout the extracellular matrix. Uh B is a schematic of C elegance   
26:07   
anterior nervous system and you can see axons from the DNC, BNC   
26:13   
and ampid neurons where they enter the nerve ring and they integrate information govern   
26:20   
behavior through these projections. So you have these different projections   
26:25   
that come through, they converge upon the nerve ring. This nerve ring integrates information and it's   
26:31   
integrating information from the surface of the body, the ferinx and the intestine. And so uh we'll take the FLP   
26:40   
neurons for as an example. The FLP neurons have extensive dendritic arber   
26:45   
that the PBD neurons uh enable mechano and mechano and   
26:51   
thermos sensation. And then in C we have uh the schematic cross-section   
26:58   
at the midbody showing these axonal tracts showing these axonal tracks in   
27:03   
relation to other structures within the body. Your figure two shows neurite developmental regulatory mechanisms. So   
27:11   
you have neurite development here where you have the that differentiating neuron   
27:17   
you have from that cell body you have these protrusions along the edge which is kind of looks kind of random   
27:24   
like it's kind of projecting in any direction it feels like but then you   
27:29   
have this next stage which is a little bit more organized which is engorgment where you get these engorgments in   
27:35   
different directions. So a set of different protrusions and directed in a   
27:40   
directed manner. Then you get consolidation where you start to get these bundles of protrusions coming out   
27:49   
from the cell body. And this is where they're consolidated into sort of the neuronal body that we're kind of more   
27:55   
used to seeing in the adult stage. So you have these different stages of   
28:01   
consolidation. This is stage one up here. Stage two. Stage one is protrusion. Stage two is consolidation.   
28:08   
Stage three is this sort of basic consolidation. Stage four is this more   
28:15   
elaborate consolidation. And then stage five is where we start getting receptors and connections with neighbors. So these   
28:23   
are your synapses here in green these green and red caps at the end. And those   
28:30   
serve as these chemical connections. Then in B they show uh where we have   
28:38   
this pioneer axon coming out. We have a developing axon by contrast   
28:43   
where the developing axon is sending out this protrusion and there's this growth cone that is sort of at the end of the   
28:51   
protrusion and that allows for the axon to find its way through the extracellular matrix. So   
28:57   
the axon is projecting out into the extracellular matrix. This growth cone   
29:04   
is a an area that senses the chemical concentrations, the chemical gradients,   
29:10   
and allows for the axon to guide itself through that. And so the growth cone is   
29:17   
is guiding it through this millu and it's heading towards the target tissue   
29:22   
eventually making a connection with the target tissue. So it's the differentiation between sort of stage   
29:28   
three and stage five of neurite development. So you can see here you have receptors   
29:35   
on the end of this growth cone. They're getting information from these chemical   
29:40   
signals and their concentrations. The microtubial polarity is moving   
29:45   
outwards towards the growth cone from the cell body. This axon is expanding   
29:51   
outward and then it's trying to reach this target tissue. And if it doesn't   
29:56   
reach the target tissue, the cell dies. But if it does reach the target tissue, then the cell can be electrically active   
30:03   
and chemically active and live another day. And it it successfully makes its   
30:08   
target say with something like the muscle or it could the muscle could impose physical restrictions on the   
30:16   
distribution of these chemicals. And sometimes if you get something like muscle differentiating   
30:22   
before the axon is reaching its target, it can actually guide it towards the   
30:27   
target tissue. And then C is where we have   
30:33   
this schematic of signals. So these signals are combinatorial. They're produced by the expression of a   
30:39   
number of genes. So you get the expression here of an 6, SLT1,   
30:45   
EN 129 and MAD 20. They have this combinatorial signal that   
30:52   
forms this gradient. So they're the secreted signals. They form this gradient. The growth cones which then   
30:58   
follow these gradients. So the target tissue is sending out a combinatorial   
31:04   
set of secreted signals. And likewise, the growth cone responds   
31:10   
to a set of secreted signals. So funk 40, funk five lad 2 make one are all   
31:17   
involved in that and that's how they can connect. So you have a set of uh genes   
31:24   
involved in the growth cone, set of genes involved in the target tissue and   
31:29   
what they're talking about here with neurite connects is largely the matching of these two signals so that the growth   
31:37   
can make it to the target tissue correct or properly.   
31:42   
And of course then the surrounding tissue uh excretes collagen 4 encoded by   
31:48   
these three genes here L 2 M9 and MAD 4 and this of course constrains this   
31:55   
gradient so that it helps the growth come along.   
32:01   
Okay so they talked about key lians in the first part of the paper introduction. So they give these two   
32:07   
tables where they kind of go over through the literature and they identify these different signals and then they   
32:14   
identify the genes that encode those signals. So you have different signal types uh and then you have different   
32:21   
genes that were identified by different references. So this is a lot of this work is a   
32:27   
metaanalysis of the literature. So they combined a meta analysis with this data   
32:32   
collection and putting together this model. So as you can see there a number of signals here we have ephrine EGF   
32:41   
slit ECM nrin went and lucel lucasite   
32:47   
cell derived chemotaxin and these are all kind of conserved across different   
32:53   
neural systems. So you often see metrin and slit and ephrine   
32:59   
um and went throughout sort of um animal   
33:05   
develop neural development. So you'll see uh different   
33:11   
uh versions of these signaling types across different nervous systems and so   
33:17   
you have these are the genes that C elegance is specified in C elegance genome. And of course you can find um   
33:24   
different homalologues and paralogues in other genomes as well.   
33:31   
Table two are membrane bound proteins that control segments neurite development. So you have these different   
33:37   
uh receptor proteins adherence um and different other types of proteins   
33:45   
and then you have the genes that encode for these proteins. So for receptors we have a number of genes that encode for   
33:51   
receptor proteins and those are reviewed in these papers. Um cadherins number of   
33:58   
genes encoding for cadherins that are cited in these papers and so on and so   
34:03   
forth. And then finally table three we have   
34:10   
transcription factors that control C elegance neurite development.   
34:15   
So this is where we have a developmental process and that developmental process   
34:20   
involves a number of different genes and their domains and then we have a they're   
34:26   
expressed in a certain neuron type. So these graphs are interesting. These are graphs that show different genes for   
34:33   
ligans and receptors, different genes for transcription factors.   
34:39   
And then this paralyze correlation or different in in these first two in A   
34:45   
and B for lians or receptors and transcription factors respectively. You   
34:50   
have these different time points from proliferating embryo to adult. So these   
34:56   
are heat maps that just showed the level of upregulation   
35:01   
for these different uh for these different genes across the developmental   
35:07   
period. So you see that there's a high degree of upregulation in the elongating embryo and the   
35:15   
three-fold embryo which is postgastation but before hatch   
35:21   
and you see there are a number of genes that are upregulated quite high you know maybe around 5 to 10fold   
35:28   
and then you have some genes that are upregulated before and after that period uh up in this part of the heat map. So,   
35:36   
you know, you have to go back and look at the function of those genes to understand that a little bit better. But   
35:41   
I like this where you have this distinction between sort of temporal   
35:47   
upregulation and then gene specific upregulation. And so you can see that pattern here   
35:54   
for transcription factors. we have we actually identify our genes along the   
36:01   
side here by their family and then uh correspondingly in in B for   
36:06   
transcription factors of the super family. So you kind of know what these gene what families and super families   
36:12   
these genes belong to and then you look at the log uh or the upregulation here.   
36:20   
So you see that there is a a very high degree of upregulation in EGL46   
36:26   
which is a zinc finger. Um and I think we've seen papers before where zinc fingers are critical for certain   
36:34   
processes. Uh we also have other things that are not very much upregulated at all. So we   
36:43   
have a number of crossdevelopmental stages a number of genes where there's   
36:48   
very little upregulation and so that's kind of interesting as well and then we have this paralyzed   
36:54   
correlation between candidate genes here where you can see that there's this   
37:02   
so you're looking at the Pearson uh you're looking at the Pearson correlation I think we misspelled Pearson here uh where you get closer to   
37:10   
one and there's a posit positive correlation and then you also have negative correlations in some areas of   
37:17   
this heat map which means that they're not only sort of at random but   
37:23   
anti-correlated and so there's a lot of information in this paper about the time course of gene expression the time   
37:29   
course of how these things are regulated and we also have more information about   
37:36   
like this visualization here where they have upregulation uh in this kind of spiral then they show   
37:42   
the transcriptional regulatory network of lians and receptors in figure five. This shows these genes   
37:50   
and how they're related in this network. And then we have the human orthologes of   
37:55   
C elegance transcription factors listed in this table. So this just shows the   
38:00   
transcription factor gene in C elegance and then the human ortholog here.   
38:07   
And then this kind of gives us a window into how to study disease   
38:12   
through kind of the application of sea elegance. So we can actually look at some interesting transcription factor   
38:20   
look at its gene origin and then we can look at the human orthologue of that gene and then we can look at if they   
38:27   
cause a disease and then we can get some information about the disease   
38:32   
description and how maybe that information about development relates to   
38:37   
human disease. So you know sea elegance is used to study all sorts of uh conditions in humans   
38:44   
um from different physiological functions to diseases and one of the key   
38:50   
components of that is that we can identify the orthologes that are involved. So the idea is that if he   
38:56   
ortholog is involved or if we have something happening in C elegance doing a developmental time   
39:03   
course and this isn't necessarily something we can study in humans we can go find the human orthologate   
39:11   
in a more controlled study in humans or develop drugs with those gene targets in   
39:18   
humans to see what happens. So this is all very interesting information as   
39:23   
well. So one of the reasons why they looked at this sort of list of genes and   
39:28   
they built all these heat maps and everything is that combinatorial gene regulation requires   
39:34   
the activity of multiple transcription factors. So they had to do this kind of looking   
39:41   
at these heat maps and then looking at these networks. One of the reasons why is because genes don't act in isolation.   
39:49   
they act in sort of networks and then they act together to form this combinatorial signal. Another   
39:55   
interesting point here is that by kind of building this combinatorial gene   
40:01   
regulatory model, they can identify not only the conditions for   
40:06   
uh growth cone persistence and the proper axonal guidance but they can also   
40:13   
identify maintenance factors which are involved in plasticity and axon growth   
40:19   
following injury. So you know this is again important for the human domain but   
40:25   
also understanding plasticity more generally.   
40:32   
So finally the dynamic and combinatorial behavior of neurite development regulators is reflected in the   
40:38   
transcryto particularly from single cell level analysis. This information may   
40:44   
shed light on how to manipulate these regulators to overcome neuronal deficits   
40:49   
and narrow degenerative decline. So that's all for today. Hopefully you   
40:54   
found this useful and see you next
