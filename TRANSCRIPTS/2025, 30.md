Hello. Hi. How are you? I'm pretty good. I'm Yeah.   
0:08   
Yeah. I haven't started into any uh heavy duty research so far. Yes. I haven't managed   
0:16   
to start um my paper. Well, I started it, but I all   
0:23   
I did was a summary of my thesis in two paragraphs. And um I'm supposed   
0:30   
to be writing a um sort of overview of   
0:37   
a modeling um epithelial tissue like who's doing what   
0:43   
type of modeling. So I'm supposed to do a literature overview and so far   
0:50   
my attempts at getting papers has been zero. So I'm zeroing.   
0:56   
Yeah. So, I've asked uh Dr. Sharief, who I was working with, if he would mind if   
1:03   
I could work through his lab to get papers from the university. Okay.   
1:09   
The only other thing is to ask Dick, I guess. Yeah. To get the papers, but that's not quite   
1:14   
fair. Yeah. Yeah. So, were you on last week or the   
1:21   
week before? Uh, no. I was off the week two weeks ago and then last week I I had a I did an   
1:28   
update but it was like no one showed up so I did a kind of a YouTube update on things.   
1:35   
Oh, okay. So I can look for that. And I'm also supposed to be finding some more salamanders so that I can um do   
1:42   
some experiments on eggs and lining it up to do optical coherence   
1:50   
tomography on salamander eggs. Oh, okay. That sounds good.   
1:56   
Yeah, that should be worth a worthwhile experiment. And like I told Dr. Sharief   
2:01   
that it it'll be a paper like get more than one image of the salamander eggs and or   
2:11   
more than one egg and several images of of the eggs and it'll be worth a   
2:17   
publication because nobody's done this. Yeah, they actually did one of xenopus eggs   
2:25   
and I can look how at how they did that and kind of match it. But I'm going to also   
2:33   
look at the density of the salamander um   
2:38   
at the same time as looking at their um blastoals. You can't really see the   
2:45   
cells with the optical coherence tomography like the definition of where   
2:52   
the cell membrane is. Yeah. But you can certainly see the blast to seal. So you can see the blast to seal   
2:59   
develop. So I thought that was that was worthwhile. You know get a baseline.   
3:06   
This is um blastil development in aximal   
3:11   
saliner. I mean, it's definitely worth a publication.   
3:17   
Yeah, sounds good. Yeah. And then you can look at other other   
3:23   
things that the eggs are doing like perhaps some cell cramps across the   
3:30   
surface, maybe distorting things a little.   
3:37   
Anyway, yeah, I know for sure they have cramps across   
3:42   
their surface and they develop. Well, that's good.   
3:49   
Yeah, good luck with that. Yeah, I don't know how many I can do at once in a batch. I was going to say, oh,   
3:56   
I'll try 10 and see how difficult that is. Yeah,   
4:02   
because I have to take at least three three scans across like three sagittal   
4:07   
slices in order to kind of project the shape and size of the blast to seal   
4:17   
and according to neology I should be taking five five sagittal   
4:23   
slices that's the industry standard Anyways,   
4:34   
that's in one go. That's right. Yeah.   
4:40   
So, I have a interesting paper today um on tensegrity   
4:46   
and just got published in bios systems. So, we'll have to go over that.   
4:52   
Found a very nice paper. um   
4:57   
about um the shape and the shape of a developing embryo and the forces in it.   
5:06   
Oh, really? Yeah. So, I'll I'll find it and I'll put   
5:11   
it in the chat. All right, that sounds good. Yeah, this is it.   
5:17   
Okay. So this is studying gastrolation by invagination the bending of a cell sheet by   
5:24   
mechanical prop cell properties using 3D deformable cell-based simulations.   
5:30   
So this is um zoom in.   
5:37   
So they're wanting to study the bending of a cell sheet in vivo. So within vivo imaging   
5:44   
um and so they're you know they basically have to separate out something   
5:49   
like a invagination and the action of the cells from other cellular processes   
5:55   
and properties that interact and so then we can do computer   
6:01   
simulations 2D computer simulations are unsuitable   
6:07   
because they don't really take into account threedimensional properties of cells. We've talked about a lot of that   
6:15   
where you have the shape of like not only as as sort of the top of the cell   
6:21   
but the sides of the cell and you know how they twist into different shapes and   
6:27   
of course cell number. Okay. And now it's making a noise.   
6:36   
Oh. Uh therefore we developed a 3D cell-based model that is able to   
6:42   
simulate cells as separate deformable entities with a conserved cell volume. So they're fixing cell volume they're   
6:51   
you know with respect to deformation and they're able to have model 3D   
6:57   
deformation of the cell. So like twisting and bending but still having the cell body intact.   
7:04   
And then they're able to form a blast by adhering cells together in into a sphere. The simulation results show that   
7:12   
changing individual mechanical properties like cell stiffness, cell   
7:17   
adhesion, and the apical constriction factor had a direct effect on the cell's   
7:23   
behavior and future shape. So they could predict the shape changes and they could   
7:29   
affect or predict the behaviors more general. These properties influence the ability   
7:35   
of a cell sheet to bend and eventually change the global shape of the embryo. So all the cells in the simulation were   
7:43   
able to have this collective effect of shape change on the embryo.   
7:48   
Um the observed shape transformations uh this transitions the endodermal   
7:54   
region. It goes through uh a number of different changes during the inward   
7:59   
bending of the cell sheet in the simulation. This can give insights into the mechanisms involved and the timing   
8:07   
of events in actual biological systems. Changing geometrical properties and they   
8:14   
give a number of examples here which is not possible in 2D models showed that   
8:19   
the inwards bending is more dependent on the number of cells involved than on the   
8:24   
shape of the endonormal region and thus that the invagination process is very   
8:29   
robust to irregularities. So this means that you know it isn't uh   
8:35   
the invagination process is usually regular across embryos and unfolds in a   
8:41   
predictable way and it's because it's robust to these irregularities.   
8:46   
When quantitatively comparing our simulation results to biological data from the literature, we saw that our   
8:53   
simulations did not exactly reproduce the shapes observed in nature. So you   
8:58   
know that's probably normal but it it's capturing a lot of aspects of that. So   
9:05   
there probably additional mechanisms at play and that that accounts for the   
9:11   
difference in the the results from you know being   
9:16   
exactly like nature. So this is a blast joy here where we have the blast   
9:24   
um and then we have the endoderm here the ectoerm   
9:30   
um and the blasters out here. So they're kind of you know showing the blastula as   
9:35   
it's as it ex occurs in nature and then the gastrilla where there's this folding   
9:42   
inward folding this invagination at the oral animal pole. So the oral   
9:47   
pore is formed at that pole and then you get the same kind of structure but you   
9:54   
get this folding inward into this uh shape here which is the   
10:00   
gastro. So that's what they're trying to mimic um those kind of shape changes.   
10:06   
And then this is shown um kind of in microscopy. So this is just showing uh this is in   
10:15   
neatestella vect uh ven vectensus and so this is just showing this um   
10:22   
these changes in that organism. Uh then this is uh their model. So zoom into the   
10:29   
model here. Um so basically they have let's see go up   
10:34   
to a here. It's kind of like a poster. um they have a number of properties of   
10:40   
the simulated cell. The cell has a cortex which is the outside which   
10:46   
consists of edges intercon uh interconnected vertices and are deformable. So you have basically this   
10:54   
uh skeleton here where you have a number of vertices with edges. They're connected by edges and then you can   
11:01   
deform this shape. So you can deform this triangle. You can uh move one ver   
11:06   
vertex inward. you can move it outward and it it shifts these edges their   
11:12   
length and their orientation and then that's relevant in forming this   
11:17   
deformable mesh. So each one of these triangles forms an element in this deformable mesh and then when the mesh   
11:25   
deforms say when something pushes on the entire surface of the mesh all of these   
11:31   
triangles deform in a coordinated manner. So if I put a weight here, if I   
11:37   
introduce some force right in in into this area of the triangulated mesh, it   
11:43   
would push everything else down and deform all of the vertices and edges with respect to position   
11:50   
and especially the length of the edge. So you can see that that's kind of how   
11:56   
they're doing this. They're putting then this triangular mesh on the surface of a sphere, which is the embryo. And so   
12:02   
you're able to measure where you're able to uh simulate the cells, you're able to   
12:08   
simulate the surface and you're not including a lot of interactions, you   
12:14   
know, that are sort of there um that you can't directly measure. You   
12:20   
can just look at how the cells sort of respond collectively to mechanical   
12:26   
properties of the embryo environment and then map that onto the surface of an   
12:32   
embryo. So when the the surface phenomena happens that can be um   
12:37   
simulated in in in silicone. Oh okay. Well this is again this is I   
12:46   
they're probably using continuum mechanics I think. And they're using triangles which are   
12:52   
the most stable um structure the most stable structure. So it's probably will   
13:01   
give different answers from real life. It it's I guess approaching it but   
13:10   
their cells are hexagonish, right? Meaning that they're not always   
13:16   
hexagons. Yeah. Anyway, they tile like   
13:21   
triangles certainly tile a surface. Hexagons tile a surface.   
13:27   
five-sided um objects plus a sevensided object tile   
13:32   
a surface. So anyways yeah and there are no gaps which might   
13:39   
be true and it might not be true in biology in embryology there's definitely um   
13:47   
tissues that have gaps like they're they're not solidly tiling something.   
13:54   
Yeah. And I mean at any one time too. So like you could have gaps that are sort   
13:59   
of itinerant and um yeah it changes. I think the I need   
14:05   
to look that up but um it was in um   
14:10   
one of the APS meetings one time. Um and I think that tail   
14:16   
um is disassociated. It tends to be.   
14:22   
Yeah. Maybe that's why it elongates. I don't know.   
14:28   
Anyways, it's interesting. Yeah, to study that. Yeah.   
14:34   
Yeah. So, let's go over a little bit more on this figure. So, yeah, there's this resting length and then you can   
14:40   
pull and you can push on the edges. So, the pushing is or I guess the pulling is   
14:46   
outward and the pushing is inward. So it's just like you know once you change the length of these edges by these sorts   
14:55   
of uh forces then you have and that translates into pulling and pushing   
15:01   
respectively. Okay. So then they they show this um kind of like the direction of the   
15:07   
forces. So they actually we have sort of this uh force orientation map where you   
15:13   
know we have changes in the sort of the forces on the surface of the sphere and   
15:19   
then changes in the sphere itself. So you know the cells the the entire embryo   
15:25   
can grow the cells can grow things can move inward or outward depending on the   
15:31   
mechanical u environment. And then on in this uh C they show the   
15:38   
adhesion region which is where basically they're showing this transition from   
15:44   
blasta to this form here where you have   
15:50   
the gastra the gastro um this this pore here that's coming inward. the embryo is   
15:58   
kind of changing its shape at the top and it's going to form this pore which   
16:04   
then has some internal structure which isn't what they're really modeling. What they're modeling is the outside of the   
16:10   
embryo and this shape change. So, you know, you want to be able to understand   
16:16   
that part. But, but this adhesion region changes as the shape changes and that's   
16:22   
the important part. So there's this effect of constriction on the shape of the adhesion region. It changes kind of   
16:29   
from this example here in the sphere to this example in the con partially   
16:35   
constricted membrane. And then we have vertex restorative   
16:41   
forces. So we have these three cells that are kind of linked together.   
16:47   
They're in contact. You have you can see how they model the cell body as a series   
16:53   
of nodes and edges. Those deform and you can see where there's an adhesion point   
16:58   
where the nodes of cell A and cell B are sort of overlapping and it sort of you   
17:07   
know each uh part of the edge of each cell is constricted in terms of shape.   
17:13   
So if they bump into one another, they push into one another and form kind of like this. It's almost like a soap   
17:20   
bubble where they bounce together, they kind of form a flat edge or they form a   
17:26   
flat boundary. And that's what you're seeing here with adhesion. And then with   
17:31   
cell B and cell C, you see collision. So you actually in the simulation you see a   
17:37   
collision where there's no adhesion where the uh nodes and edges for cell B and cell C   
17:44   
overlap and so then that's a violation of course so they have to have this uh boundary   
17:52   
violation resolution which is where repulsive forces are proportional to the   
17:58   
depth of vertex penetration. So you have this repulsive force that   
18:04   
acts when there's some collision of some depth. So that's basically how they   
18:09   
manage that in the simulation. So they basically um manage this as an additive   
18:15   
model where they have the total forces are each element plus the volume plus   
18:22   
repulsion plus adhesion. So all these components go into the sum total of forces. So um there's the force of   
18:30   
adhesion, there's the force of this uh propulsion as a result of collision,   
18:37   
there's the each element and then the volume itself. Uh the displacement is found by using   
18:43   
Newton's second law of motion together with the verlay algorithm as the numerical solver. And then this is the   
18:49   
equation here. So um yeah and then pulling vertices together you have this   
18:55   
force of adhesion which is you know they have the physics here where um you know   
19:03   
if you have this certain distance you have uh adhesion and that pulls these   
19:09   
edges together so that you have these cells that don't have gaps in between.   
19:15   
It's interesting how they have to deal with these uh edge cases like collision and they resolve that by doing some sort   
19:22   
of repulsion and that's sort of you know correcting when you don't get adhesion   
19:28   
the way it's supposed to happen. Now we don't actually I mean you know this may   
19:33   
happen in biology somewhat. I mean obviously they can't overlap but you can   
19:39   
have like you know cases where two cells will collide and bounce off of one another and then have to sort of form an   
19:45   
adhesion and the adhesive forces aren't strong enough. So that's kind of what they're getting at. They're trying to   
19:52   
resolve cases where they can't get adhesion using this method. Then they're multisellular simulations. So you have   
20:00   
these are the cell bodies. You have this uh the first case here 128 simulated   
20:08   
cells. You have endoderm the cells that are in salmon on the left side of this   
20:13   
sphere. And then you have ectoerm and beige which are the ones over the right side of the sphere.   
20:21   
So this is simulating the blastula where you have the shape and the   
20:28   
direction and everything. The cells are here. They actually have some gaps in here as you can see. Um and they're   
20:34   
going to form then the second 128 simulated cell um simulation where   
20:43   
the cells are adhered to each other in these hexagons. So you see in the cir in   
20:48   
the spherical cells coming together to form this em this uh this embryo uh   
20:56   
there are these gaps and what they're trying to do is resolve the gaps. So if we go back to where they're the cells   
21:02   
are adhering they haven't adhered yet they're just kind of in this form and so   
21:07   
they have to adhere uh for this you know to to model the physics properly. So   
21:12   
here's where they're all adhered and all resolved. So now you have these um these   
21:19   
hexagons and there are no gaps within the the body of the embryo. So it's   
21:25   
forming this multisellular structure that has like kind of a constant contact   
21:31   
between everything. And then this is the third example. This is an internal view   
21:36   
of this structure. So if we take the second structure and look at like a cross-section of it, we can see adhesion   
21:43   
zones and these are colored in light blue.   
21:49   
So they pull those cells together slightly apart and they want to show the cell cell adhesion. Cell cell adhesion   
21:56   
are in these black lines. And so that's the idea that there are these   
22:03   
that the there's a cell adhesion process. They don't model all the   
22:09   
molecular components here of course, but they're they're kind of modeling these   
22:14   
adhesions as physical phenomena and then just, you know, kind of showing where   
22:20   
that would be. Okay. In a in an axelottle egg, you actually   
22:27   
get um you can see it see them turn from slightly rounded to flattened   
22:35   
cells on the surface. Yeah. So,   
22:41   
yeah. Yeah. Which is the middle part there. Yeah. So, that was uh that was figure   
22:49   
three. And then they kind of go through constriction which is this figure here constriction modes. So basically they   
22:56   
simulate this and show all the different modes of constriction. Um they show cell stiffness and con   
23:05   
constriction factor. So they vary the cell stiffness to see if that you know how that plays a role.   
23:12   
Yeah. I'd like to know what software they're using. Um I'm not sure. Let's see if we can   
23:18   
find it. methods. I haven't I haven't read this. Yeah, that would be good to see it.   
23:24   
Okay, so they're using a lot of math. I see. Um   
23:31   
really giving I mean they're giving a lot of detail, but they're not giving any information about the environment.   
23:37   
Did they make their own? They may have. I'm not sure though. Yeah. Well, a lot of people do.   
23:43   
Yeah. Which probably isn't good because you need to have a standard. Yes, it would be   
23:50   
nice to have some sort of standard. Okay. Yeah. So, I don't I don't see any   
23:57   
information on the environment other than like Yeah. Because they said our vertex model was specifically developed   
24:04   
to simulate the bending of a cell sheet in a blast. So, they developed this I   
24:09   
guess in homebrewed manner. Looks like it. Yeah.   
24:15   
But, uh yeah. And then so they yeah they're able to do a lot of interesting things here. But again this this   
24:23   
adhesion part was interesting because I mean both in a good and a bad way   
24:28   
because on one hand you have you model adhesions but on the other hand it's just kind of like these lines and it's   
24:35   
kind of like there's an adhesion. What is what does it involve? Well, it's a process, but I don't, you know, I'll just kind of draw a black line or we'll   
24:42   
model it as a sing single process. Yeah. Yeah.   
24:49   
More complicated. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So, I think that's good.   
24:54   
Thank you, Susan, for showing us that paper. Um, oh, thank you, Dick.   
25:00   
Yeah. Oh, okay. Thank you, Dick. two.   
25:05   
Okay, why don't we go to the bio biotin segrity paper which I know you've been waiting for. Um   
25:13   
would it be possible for you to send me that reference? Yeah, I will   
25:18   
in an email because Yeah, my computer's only is limping along.   
25:23   
Yeah, try to get it resolved soon. I think it's might be my it's some sort of   
25:32   
um blocker that's blocking the Microsoft from downloading.   
25:38   
Oh, might be my eero. E R O   
25:47   
I don't know. I'm not sure. I have to get to the bottom of it. Yeah.   
25:53   
Okay. Um so this is the biotengrity paper. I'll send you this reference. Um   
26:00   
this is uh uh Stephen Leven is on this   
26:05   
lazo is on this. Um this is Graham Scar too.   
26:11   
Yeah. He's into tenseity and biology. Yeah. Um this is biotensity is the super   
26:20   
stability hypothesis for biology. So this is a theoretical paper. This is   
26:25   
in bios systems of course that being that um so this is um let's go through   
26:32   
the abstract. Uh biotensgrity models living systems in   
26:38   
ways that were inconceivable in the past but has taken some time to become widely   
26:43   
accepted because it challenges generally accepted wisdom. So orthodox   
26:49   
biomechanics is essentially based on mechanistic models of the 17th century   
26:55   
and allowed oversimplified representations of anatomy and motion to persist to the   
27:01   
present day. So there's a lot of you know if you look at modern biomechanical   
27:07   
models based on Newtonian physics and kind of thinking about the a biological   
27:14   
system as a mechanical system you know with physics but then you know they   
27:20   
didn't really have a lot of biological terms involved nor are there like you know emergent phenomena usually those   
27:27   
aren't really discussed in a orthodox biomechanics model. Um   
27:33   
so that's their their point here. Living organisms however are hugely complex   
27:39   
intrinsically interdeterminate and exist in states that are far from equilibrium   
27:44   
and although their simplification within the machine model has enabled great progress in the mapping of structure   
27:51   
function and benefited our healthcare system in remarkable ways. it has also obuscated   
27:57   
the foundational basis for stability, motion and life itself. So then they're   
28:03   
contrasting this sort of uh orthodox model with a biotingrity model. And so   
28:10   
biotensgrity is a conceptual framework that is founded on a fundamental set of self-organizing principles and includes   
28:18   
all complexities of life at every heterarchical level uh from viruses to   
28:24   
vertebrates and molecules. So the whole organism with stability and motion   
28:29   
controlled from within the structure itself and the homeostatic algorithm of   
28:35   
superstability. So I guess they're arguing that um there is this model   
28:41   
that's a biomechanical model at heart but it's also kind of more biologically   
28:47   
plausible as well as having these properties of complex systems and   
28:52   
dynamical systems. So they talk about far from equilibrium, they talk about   
28:57   
homeostasis, they talk about um heterarchy actually.   
29:03   
So you know that's those are all kind of buzzwords but I don't know how they put them together here.   
29:09   
Um here anatomy is no longer reduced to a set of discrete parts but becomes the physical representation of a hugely   
29:16   
complex pattern of interacting force vectors and which are themselves organized within a complex tense   
29:23   
configuration that enables each part of the system to adapt to its locally   
29:28   
changing environment in the most energyefficient way. And so then and   
29:34   
that also remains stable throughout that process.   
29:39   
So yeah, they're they're kind of hitting on tense or biotense   
29:45   
as being uh based on a fundamental set of self-organizing principles. So they   
29:51   
kind of bring this around to self-organization. um they talk about tensgrity structures   
29:59   
being the physical representation of invisible force vectors.   
30:04   
Living organisms are intrinsically stable tense frameworks. Um the closed   
30:10   
chain kinematics of tensgrity replaces the contrived machine lever model. So   
30:15   
like you know if you think about kinematic chains they're closed kinematic chains that uh you know you   
30:21   
you have forces that are propagated outward from a central. So if you have forces that are generated at some point   
30:28   
in the uh at the sort of the origin of the uh kinematic chain those forces   
30:34   
propagate outward and a lot of times are not controlled in their output. So if you think about like uh ballistic   
30:41   
movement of the arm, you're throwing a baseball or something, you know, you generate forces in your muscles and that   
30:47   
force goes outward and then you know there's an output that is this ballistic   
30:52   
movement. And so you can you know they use this in robotic control where they   
30:58   
try to model that as a kinematic chain and they try to control not just the origin point of the the forces but the   
31:05   
end point as well at the end effect. But in in a closed chain kinematic system, all of that is sort of self-contained in   
31:12   
maybe like a sphere or some system where those forces are sort of managing each   
31:19   
other where they're balancing each other and they're forming this self-organized   
31:25   
structure that allows things to sort of persist in a certain state. And so this   
31:31   
is kind of an interesting kind of way to think about this. And then of course the machine lever model is a a classic model   
31:38   
of mechanics. If you think about go back to your simple machines that you learned about in elementary school where you   
31:45   
learn about different machines that do work. Um that one of them is is the machine lever where you have a a lever   
31:53   
that you pull and it pulls something up or down. So you can pull on a lever and   
31:59   
it lifts something up. You can push on a lever, it pushes something down. and that uh it's basically transferring   
32:06   
physical work. And so a lot of uh biomechanics is based on those kind of   
32:12   
simple machines. What they're saying is that you can model things um not just   
32:17   
with simple machines but with these kind of uh new structures or novel structures.   
32:24   
Then finally superstability as a general mathematical framework um you know can   
32:30   
be done and this can be biologically plausible and model biological transformations.   
32:36   
And so um they basically have this quote here, the principle of organization is   
32:41   
the fundamental source of biological stability, which is an interesting quote because it basically suggests that you   
32:49   
have to have some sort of stable structure for organi biological   
32:55   
organization to occur. So if we think about multisellular systems like we just saw in the last paper you know all those   
33:03   
cells kind of exist in you know they could exist in a cluster and they could   
33:09   
be kind of free moving in that cluster they could just be kind of loosely associated but you know you also have   
33:17   
multisellular systems that are integrated both structurally and functionally. What they're saying is   
33:23   
that there's this functional interaction or interconnection. That's the key.   
33:29   
You're modeling modeling this with standard   
33:34   
um software causes problems because they think the building has broken and it's   
33:40   
just just the cells moving naturally. At least that's the that's what I began to   
33:46   
think of. Yeah. when I was modeling it because it just   
33:52   
it would say no it's not working and really all it did was do whatever   
33:59   
tense do when they um change shape so they're changing shape from one shape to   
34:06   
another and oops the building's broken well no it isn't it's just changing shape   
34:14   
buildings don't usually change shape but that's kind of the point Yes, that's the point.   
34:21   
Yes. So, I you'd have to reinvent the software,   
34:27   
right? Yeah. In order to do that, that means software   
34:34   
that works with something that's more movable than a building. Right. Right.   
34:42   
So, yeah. Then they they kind of talk about um this idea of developing kind of   
34:49   
a new way of thinking about this. Um and then we are the so the first part is we   
34:55   
are not machines. So you know there are a lot of mechanistic theories you know   
35:01   
biomechanics where you're just thinking about the mechanics and then you know uh we have to think   
35:09   
kind of beyond that. So this is kind of getting into this.   
35:14   
The problem is that living organisms are hugely complex, intrinsically indeterminate and exist in states that   
35:21   
are far from equilibrium. And although the simplification within the machine model has enabled great   
35:28   
progress, it has also obuscated this uh foundational basis for life. And then uh   
35:38   
the ability to overlook the approximations, assumptions and unknowns inherent within standard analytical   
35:44   
methods is routinely accepted as part of the modeling process. Riley noting there   
35:50   
these these citations here u or Bertrren Russell I guess is the source of this   
35:56   
quote. Riley noting that all exact science is dominated by the idea of approximation.   
36:03   
So that's kind of, you know, we have to approximate things like we saw in the last paper with the adhesion contact   
36:10   
points being these black lines. There's a whole process underlying that. We don't care about that just to get a   
36:17   
handle on their general functional role. But of course you need to have those   
36:23   
details and it you know if you have a better model that can incorporate those   
36:28   
details then then that's something that you should uh maybe consider to be a better hypothesis.   
36:35   
In any case um so they they talk about how the machine metaphor is embedded in   
36:41   
all of our thinking about you know molecular biology um and how we Oh go ahead. Sorry,   
36:49   
they're quoting Belusv, so this is good. Approve.   
36:55   
Okay. Yeah. Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Here he is. Bellisov. Um   
37:00   
uh and so yeah. Um in most discussions about laws,   
37:06   
principles, and unifying frameworks beginning at these relatively high levels of complexity.   
37:11   
So again, we're talking about, you know, different laws and principles in physics. And you know one of the aims of   
37:19   
physics is to extract laws from data so that first of all um nature is lawful   
37:27   
and that we can kind of extract laws that we can predict and and rely on. And   
37:32   
you know if you're doing something like bioengineering that's a very important thing to to want to have because you   
37:38   
want to be able to exploit that to to build controllable systems.   
37:43   
But on the other hand, you know, you're you can't just invent those laws. They   
37:48   
have to be there and and they have to be there at a high level of complexity because if they're just kind of trivial   
37:54   
laws, then it doesn't really do anything for anyone. Um, and so this popular view of the cell   
38:01   
as a factor for producing molecular machines says little about the underlying rules of life. Although the   
38:08   
gene is an essential source of information in the production of proteins and other molecular processes,   
38:14   
uh Nicholson noted that its products are released into a cellular millu that   
38:20   
already possess a spatial structure and this is shaped by pre-existing   
38:25   
self-organizing processes. So you know if you think about a cell you know you   
38:30   
have all these molecular processes going on but there is also the there's already this spatial structure that exists.   
38:37   
Sometimes it's you know compartmentalization. Uh sometimes it's just kind of the the   
38:43   
way that you know things are organized within the cell like organels or you   
38:49   
know the the process of cell division or whatever. And sometimes of course it's this organization between cells where   
38:56   
you have cells that interact. You might have like um secretions that occur   
39:04   
through molecular processes that guide collective behavior of cells. Um you   
39:10   
also have a lot of complexity at the cell membrane and that of course controls things like   
39:15   
adhesion and other types of you know signaling through u uh uh surface   
39:22   
receptors and things like that. So you know these are all kind of have to be accounted for in a theory like this.   
39:29   
there's all this existing self-organizing process that you know when you have a process that say evolves   
39:37   
uh or you know you have like a process that you're measuring in terms   
39:42   
of its molecular content um that's organized around a lot of existing spatial structure we have to take that   
39:49   
into account in our models um so what are the basic principles that   
39:55   
enable an organism to develop self-organize operate in the most energy efficient way   
40:00   
to remain intrinsically stable. And that's what we're trying to do. And we're trying to find particular the   
40:06   
superstable state where you have all these different changes over time and   
40:12   
it's stable nonetheless. So we want to have the superstable state. That's what we're looking for.   
40:20   
And so, you know, it kind of goes into the idea of laws in biology and how the   
40:25   
laws of motion and thermodynamics are considered universal. But a lot of these complex processes   
40:32   
within cells um you know we don't really understand the laws of motion and thermodynamics in   
40:39   
the context of a lot of these biological processes at the cellular level anyways   
40:44   
like you know cell function, development, reproduction, regeneration.   
40:51   
And so, you know, we we kind of call a lot of this epigenetics, kind of throw that into that bin. So, if you have   
40:59   
interactions between cells and tissues, we have, you know, different things that are we might call extra genetic. And   
41:07   
there's just this box of change called epigenetic processes. And so this is,   
41:13   
you know, maybe not very useful for really understanding a lot of complex   
41:18   
behaviors and thinking about things not as kind of mechanical hard mechanical systems but   
41:27   
soft matter systems. And you know there's a whole field of course of soft matter physics that people have been   
41:32   
applying to developmental biology in the last couple decades. Um and you know   
41:39   
there have been a lot of interesting findings about you know uh populations of cells in tissues how   
41:47   
tissue sheets behave collectively how cells migrate collectively but there's   
41:52   
still this aspect of not understanding at the soft matter level what the laws are and how thermodynamics operates. So   
42:00   
there's still this need for a unifying theory around this sort of soft matter   
42:05   
perspective and more generally around uh mechanics and physics that govern these   
42:13   
kind of systems. Um so that's where they introduce tensity. They define tense as the   
42:22   
unification of tension and integrity. So it's this port mantto of tension and   
42:27   
integrity and then describes a structural system that consists of a set of discrete compression elements which   
42:34   
are these struts. So like in the last paper we saw the nodes and edges. The   
42:39   
edges here are these struts. So they're physically manifest as struts. So they   
42:45   
actually introduce compression on these different   
42:50   
um or I'm sorry the struts are out the the nodes and the cables are the things   
42:55   
that are tensioned. So the discrete compression elements are struts. There   
43:01   
are these uh nodes and you can see in this model here where you have sort of   
43:07   
the nodes and the edges and then you have the nodes which are the struts and these are compression elements and then   
43:14   
they're suspended within a network of tensioned elements or cables. So again you can push on a cable and it   
43:21   
introduces tension. You can pull on it, you can compress it and then you know   
43:26   
that affects the rest of the network and then the the activity of the struts can   
43:32   
also affect that as well. It can drive this process. It can be internal to the   
43:38   
network or external I guess. So this is where they kind of go they review first   
43:44   
of all Buckminister Fuller which who was the person who originated tenseity   
43:50   
actually in architecture and you've seen the um Bucky ball which   
43:56   
is the C60 element uh where you have a structure of carbon um and that's that's   
44:04   
a that's a what they call a Bucky ball which is a Buckminster puller inspired   
44:09   
structure. Um, he's also built, if you've ever uh seen a geodeic dome in   
44:14   
the wild, those are these structures that are half circle or half spheres and   
44:20   
they exist, they're held stable, you know, as a product of tensity.   
44:27   
And so then this made its way into biology around the late 90s into the bots. And they have these citations here   
44:35   
where there's this new structural principle where you know you don't necessarily have uh traditional physical   
44:42   
principle you know there's this principle of kind of um I guess that you   
44:48   
know first of all that you have this sort of dynamic tension and that things   
44:53   
are held in dynamic tension and the other aspect is that this is self-organized in some way. So you have   
45:01   
to have this structure whatever it is it's you know you could think of a cell   
45:06   
as being the structure a cell membrane and it's held in stability but you know   
45:12   
how do you how does it sort of form? Does it form by a single node and then   
45:18   
another node and then connecting with a some sort of connection and then having   
45:24   
additional nodes added? How does that form while also retaining that same stability?   
45:30   
So you know this is the kind of maybe the problem of origins for biotense segrity where you have this complex   
45:36   
structure and you can observe but how do you start off with that structure? How do you how do you get it started and   
45:43   
then of course how does it get maintained over time. So um tensgrity models are strong,   
45:50   
flexible and resistant and physical properties that are similar to living tissues in many ways and they have some   
45:56   
citations here. uh they change shape with a minimum of effort and automatically return to the   
46:02   
same stable position of equilibrium irrespective of the direction of gravity   
46:08   
and remain intrinsically stable. When one part changes the entire system becomes involved thus enabling forces,   
46:16   
power and information to be transferred from one region to another in a controlled way.   
46:24   
So this is um these are the stress strain curves for materials.   
46:30   
Um and so this is um a is hook's law   
46:36   
which is linearity uh over this region of the stress strain curve and then it   
46:42   
so this this is uh where you're have an input of stress and an output of strain   
46:47   
or an input of strain and output of stress and that's a linear relationship under hook's law then in B and C you   
46:55   
have the nonlinear behavior of tensergy in living tissues so you have this these   
47:00   
quaile linear ranges but they're decoupled and they're you know the whole   
47:06   
regime isn't linear. So you might expect for some strain values the stress values   
47:11   
to be linear and then there's this phase transition where the stress values uh   
47:16   
are much different given the input strain values and then you have these   
47:21   
qua linear regions which are local but not global. Yeah. They have a change of state.   
47:29   
Yeah. Yeah, change of state this. So this is uh this is an example here and   
47:34   
see the physiological range is this part of the quiz linear region here and then   
47:40   
micro failures are in this second linear region. So you might go from like the   
47:46   
normal physiological range to this phase transition where you have a failure or collapse of the system or some breakage   
47:54   
and so then you have this difference in the stress strain curve and you have to   
48:00   
undergo phase transition to get there but it's very different behavior but it's basically the same structure.   
48:06   
Um and then D through F are some further examples of complex tissue fluid   
48:12   
behaviors which we call soft matter behaviors. So you might have different stress string curves for different   
48:18   
materials. So if you are modeling a cell collagen might have one behavior and   
48:24   
cortical bone might have another behavior. Of course you have to account for that in your model. So if you have   
48:31   
like you know u a model of a of a limb where you have cortical bone hard bone   
48:38   
and then you have a collagen and you have skin and you have muscle those all have different stress string curves. So   
48:44   
you have to account for those in proportion when you're modeling the actual limb of an arm or leg or   
48:51   
something like that. Um then this is uh uh E is where you have constant stress   
48:58   
where you have creep and relaxation and then uh stress over time which is   
49:04   
fixatropian uh riopsy riopexi I guess   
49:11   
was that yeah it's okay the names I'm laughing at the names   
49:19   
yeah so this is uh this first one e is time versus strain. So you're looking at   
49:25   
strain over time and then the second one is stress time and viscosity. So it's   
49:32   
like this stress over time and then viscosity. And this is kind of the   
49:38   
behavior of the material. So fixotropy is like if you take a   
49:43   
ketchup bottle and you kind of turn it upside down and it's and the ketchup starts flowing. That's axotropic   
49:50   
medium. has different behaviors, right? That works with um clay as well.   
49:57   
Okay. Yeah. Very hard and then then you mix it up and then it it flows.   
50:04   
Yeah. The sort of material and cells are like that quite often.   
50:09   
Yeah. I still would like to see a stress strain curve um when I'm reading about   
50:17   
these things instead of just oh well here's the um strain time curve like the   
50:25   
creeper relaxation. Um that's fine too actually. But um I still   
50:34   
was looking for stress drain curves and I would often get oh this is a creep and   
50:39   
relaxation behavior. Anyways yeah so like for example   
50:46   
with f you if you apply stress over a certain amount of time the response   
50:52   
isn't immediate. The response builds up. Yeah. And there's a change in viscosity   
50:58   
as the stress accumulates over time. Or rather, if you apply a stress maybe over   
51:04   
a minute, say rather than 5 seconds, you get a different, you know, you get a flow versus no flow. So if I just kind   
51:11   
of turn a ketchup bottle over briefly and then put it back right side up, it doesn't really flow. But if I turn it   
51:16   
over and hold it upside down, it's introducing stresses and it's pushing it out and it's flowing. So it's like you   
51:24   
have to give it like this kind of initial input or this collective input of of stress to get it to move. And so   
51:32   
that's kind of the idea there. And you know that's just a property of the material a property of you know of that   
51:40   
flow. Acts like crazy is it crazy putty or no?   
51:46   
Silly putty. Silly putty. Yeah. Yeah. Silly putty. Silly putty. I think we need a crazy putty actually.   
51:52   
Yeah, cells are crazy putty. Yeah. So, there are two components here.   
51:59   
One is that there's this behavior that changes over time and that's nonlinear.   
52:05   
And then there's this other component where you have this sort of composite nature of things. So like not every you   
52:11   
know if you have a if you're trying to model a system not every component of the system behaves the same way. You   
52:17   
can't assume homogeneity. You have to assume some heterogeneity. You have to   
52:22   
assume some sort of sort of nonlinearity over time. And so yeah.   
52:28   
Yes. And definitely has a time component because the faster you compress it, the   
52:35   
stiffer it'll be. That just and it's kind of obvious when you think of it. Um   
52:42   
but um different tissues have a different uh time component too   
52:48   
right to how fast they can react. So they talk about biotensgrity as   
52:55   
embracing the principles of self-organization. So they show this example here where   
53:00   
cells are coming into contact like we saw in the last paper. They're forming these networks or clumps of cells. these   
53:08   
networks become more complex and then those networks form these sheets of cells that do things collectively. So   
53:16   
you have two cells that are existing in isolation. They come together they might form of course some sort of adhesion or   
53:25   
they might you know kind of form a boundary and then of course if a number of cells do that you form this network   
53:32   
and then more cells join in. When you get cell division, you get this more complex network.   
53:37   
Then you get a tissue. I would prefer to see that last um diagram see as um a group of bubbles.   
53:46   
Yeah. Yeah. Rather than that because those are still   
53:51   
disassociated from each other more or less. Right.   
53:57   
Right. Yeah. They have the networks here but they don't show it here where the   
54:03   
shape. Yeah. Yeah.   
54:10   
Um and then we talk about closed kinematic chains here. So this is kind   
54:15   
of getting into this linkage system idea uh where you have uh multiple bars which   
54:23   
is this linkage system maybe from the origin of a force to its output and   
54:29   
these multiple bars will move kind of semi you know going to be hinged and   
54:34   
they move kind of together. They have to be coordinated by some force. Um they   
54:40   
are coupled into these continuous mechanical loops with each one influencing the other's position. So as   
54:46   
you move outward from the source of the force, these bars will coordinate their movement. So, if you think about like um   
54:55   
double a dual pendulum, if you've ever seen one of those, where you have if you have a a single pendulum, of course, it   
55:02   
moves back and forth and it's um it's deterministic in its movement. But if   
55:07   
you have um a double pendulum, you have one pendulum and then a second pendulum   
55:13   
that's hinged onto the bottom of the first one, those dynamics are much more complex because you have two pendula   
55:20   
that are kind of moving semi-independently. There's still one influences the other,   
55:25   
but there's this, you know, that's an example of a chaotic system,   
55:30   
right? Region. Yeah. Yes. and tense segrees are like that   
55:38   
when you have two bars attached to each other which you would get in cells. So   
55:44   
it it tends to be a chaotic system con a constrained chaotic system but it's   
55:50   
still a chaotic system. It depends on initial conditions.   
55:55   
Right. Right. Yeah. So I mean that's the idea of a like a kinematic chain which I   
56:02   
talked about before which is this where you have this chain of movement outward and you know it gets less controlled as   
56:10   
you move outward. Um but of course in in say like a cell like we've been seeing   
56:16   
we don't have an open kinematic chain we have a closed kinematic chain. So that means that you have like this double   
56:23   
pendulum, but it's connected back to the origin, which is interesting.   
56:29   
Yeah. I I can tell you all about it. Yeah. Like the computer program that would   
56:36   
never work. Yeah. Yes. And of course, as Susan says, it doesn't   
56:42   
make it any easier to predict just because it's connected back to the source because it's usually more more   
56:48   
than like a double pendulum. It's a multi- um segmented pendulum and then   
56:54   
it's connected back to the source and that the source has to respond to that force that's now being brought back to   
57:01   
it. So now it has to regulate itself and there's this Yes. And on top of that, these linkages   
57:09   
change, right? Because it's a living cell, of course.   
57:15   
Yeah. So they show their model here, a four bar mechanism showing the pin joints,   
57:22   
trajectories, and limits of three moving bars in relation to a fixed or horizontal reference bar. And then the   
57:29   
changing angles, alpha over beta that define its nonlinear behavior. So this   
57:35   
is all kind of the way this is uh this and the first has a geometry in the cell. We're going to have a specific   
57:41   
geometry. It's not just kind of a pendulum moving you know freely in space. It's it's this constrained   
57:49   
geometry and then you have these forces operating in this system. So you know   
57:56   
this is kind of the problem here. We have a very complex system because As we   
58:04   
just mentioned, a double pendulum can produce chaotic behavior and that's, you   
58:09   
know, pretty complex. And we have this multi-jointed pendulum that's connected back to the   
58:16   
origin. And it basically that means is that it has to all the forces in a   
58:21   
system have to be kind of responded to by other components of the system to maintain its stability. So that's and   
58:29   
then of course if you use like a classical physics program to model that it's going to give you a lot of failure   
58:35   
points because it's not going to understand that kind of feedback and   
58:40   
it's not going to understand that the different aspects of that. So um these closed kinematic chains have   
58:49   
been described in the feeding mechanisms of fish, shrimps and humans, the fasical   
58:56   
connective tissues and the limbs of horses and humans. So you know this is   
59:01   
just kind of going into some of the biomechanics of kinematics or biomechanics of tenseity.   
59:08   
Um and then of course in kinematics we use algebraic equations to describe the   
59:14   
geometry of motion. But of course in tense we have to think   
59:20   
a little bit differently. um you know we we basically are mimicking the basic mechanics of 10   
59:27   
segrity by using these clothes chain kinematics but we need maybe something more than algebraic equations to model   
59:34   
this um this is another tense model the tikosa   
59:41   
model um so they have what are these called Susan where you have the three   
59:47   
bars and the four bars the three bars and the four bars Yeah, like these examples here.   
59:55   
Um I mean what are the usual what's the the sort of the jargon that they use for it?   
1:00:02   
Oh, okay. Um I'm drawing a blank. So um   
1:00:09   
yeah, the T3 and a T4. Oh, okay. Maybe that's   
1:00:16   
Yeah. So it's a calling it a TI CASA model. So yeah.   
1:00:22   
Yeah. A T3 is um um   
1:00:29   
a little pyramid. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of   
1:00:38   
anyways um is it a pyramid? [Music]   
1:00:45   
Sorry. It's um a three-sided. It's a three a three-sided ten segrity is   
1:00:51   
called a T3. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways,   
1:00:58   
and it's the simplest one and it's very stable again because it's triangles.   
1:01:03   
Yeah. And you can do all kinds of things with with T3s   
1:01:09   
in in an ordinary um simulation package that you can't do with with the T4 or   
1:01:16   
any of these other shapes because they're very stable.   
1:01:22   
That's why I chose T3s for my um   
1:01:27   
connections. Yeah. Between cells. And well, they they are a triangle anyway. Nature Nature   
1:01:36   
discovered T3s way before we did. Yeah, because that's uh the tri   
1:01:43   
junctions, right? Are essentially a T3.   
1:01:50   
So they they give some maybe some biological examples here. Monoarticular   
1:01:55   
muscles might then be considered as a variable length set of bars within three bar systems or T3s.   
1:02:03   
While biorarticular isometric muscles can form tensionally stiff bars within   
1:02:09   
four bar systems or T4 that enable multiple joints to be coupled in ways   
1:02:15   
that transfer power from one part of the body to another in a controlled way. So   
1:02:20   
there are these uh structures called muscle synergies which are where you have like a bunch of muscles that are   
1:02:26   
activated during the movement versus just kind of like looking at single muscles as they articulate on the   
1:02:33   
joints. So you're getting this different level of coordination. You're getting the one layer of coordination with the   
1:02:40   
T3 and another layer of coordination with the T4. And I don't have the the   
1:02:45   
cellular analogy to that. I guess you know maybe something with actin   
1:02:51   
molecules or something acting maybe collectively versus independently.   
1:02:56   
That might be one way to think about it. But this just shows this difference between   
1:03:02   
the uh muscle synergy and you know the muscle movement and kind of how this is   
1:03:08   
related to a closed chain geometry. So you know the muscle is of course   
1:03:14   
reacting to it it's being stretched and muscle synergies are reacting to some   
1:03:20   
intentional in out you know input or output and they're coordinating you know   
1:03:26   
according so you have this sort of you can think about muscle movements in in   
1:03:32   
the body in in their our bodies as an example of this closed chain geometry.   
1:03:39   
Okay. And the bones are the rods and they're a very important part of the system.   
1:03:45   
Right. Right. But what operates the system of course are the muscles in blue here   
1:03:50   
shown shown in blue. Yeah. The muscle provides the or the the bone   
1:03:56   
and provides the underlying stability. The muscle provides the the movement the coordinated movement where it does it   
1:04:03   
provides maybe some power to that movement I guess. Um and so   
1:04:10   
Yeah, that's that's what looks like. They just give that example. Um, and then   
1:04:17   
so they kind of go through that. Then they talk about structure, stability and energetics   
1:04:22   
where uh the concept of bio tensegrity is predicated on anatomy is the physical   
1:04:29   
representation of a hugely complex pattern of interacting force vectors. So   
1:04:34   
plan on what we saw in the muscles and the bone where there's this set of   
1:04:39   
interacting force vectors and the body is sort of the structure that it that that's organized.   
1:04:46   
Um and then uh there's a sufficient separation of these into different structural modes cable threats stretch   
1:04:54   
slars as their closed chain interactions that allow such systems to change shape   
1:05:01   
while remaining intrinsically stable throughout. So I think they talk about figures four and five that's way up   
1:05:08   
above. Um but figure seven shows this tensegrity portraited as an energy   
1:05:14   
framework. So you have um in a you have   
1:05:20   
this energy framework with these red lines and these blue lines. The red   
1:05:25   
lines shown in B are isolated sets of points which are the nodes and vertices.   
1:05:31   
So you have the nodes which are isolated and then they're connected by vertices.   
1:05:37   
That's sort of the physical connection between them. And then C are the point combinations   
1:05:44   
which are the edges that can get closer together but not further apart.   
1:05:50   
Um then they say compression. Yeah. Yeah. Point combinations or edges that   
1:05:56   
get further apart but not closer together. The intention. Yeah. Yeah.   
1:06:02   
So they show that there's this structure that has two components.   
1:06:07   
You have sort of the isolated set of points and then you have the point combinations.   
1:06:13   
And that's kind of the way to model this. Um and then the stability of the   
1:06:18   
framework is then achieved through coupled changes in the elastic strain energies as the springs or the edges   
1:06:26   
uh automatically seek their minimal energy states. So these edges are always   
1:06:32   
trying to minimize their energy. But when you have forces uh maybe operating   
1:06:37   
from the outside or when those points need to make changes in their orientation or their organizational   
1:06:44   
state then you get these um disruptions in the minimal energy state. So if you   
1:06:50   
think about it like uh in homeostasis where you have a homeostatic state which   
1:06:56   
is a relaxed state where everything's at minimal energy and then you introduce   
1:07:01   
perturbations to that. you stretch on something or you push something together   
1:07:06   
or you move change its orientation. Maybe the cell changes shape or the the muscles get activated. Uh the limbs   
1:07:14   
change their uh orientation and those are all introducing   
1:07:20   
um you know energetic states that are not minimal. So then the system has to find its way back to the minimal   
1:07:25   
energetic state and in doing so it has to find its way back to equilibrium or   
1:07:31   
to homeostasis. So there's some homeostatic set point that the system exists at. It's moved in different   
1:07:38   
directions and then it has to find its way back to equilibrium back to the homeostatic state. And that's so that's   
1:07:46   
how you achieve superstability and that you you know you can perturb the system in a lot of ways and you can   
1:07:53   
get these nonlinear responses that occur in you know kind of returning back to   
1:07:58   
that minimal state that homeostatic state and so you know that that's does raise   
1:08:06   
an interesting question which is that you can change the number of edges and the number of nodes in the system uh as   
1:08:14   
the anatomy evolves as it develops or as you just simply get deformationations in   
1:08:20   
the shape. So you know if you're talking about like a cell and it's dividing you   
1:08:26   
know that cell divides and there's this process of kind of breaking this tense   
1:08:32   
structure into two parts or replicating the tense segrity structure when doing   
1:08:38   
it in a way that breaks its continuity. You know how do you recover that shape? how do you recover that structure? And   
1:08:45   
so this is kind of what they're getting at in this section. Um they talk about   
1:08:52   
how um the edges can be freely split into shorter ones with new vertices   
1:08:57   
thereby increasing their total count or connected into longer ones that decrease the number of vertices all without all   
1:09:05   
without compromising system stability. So the edges can get longer, shorter,   
1:09:11   
divide, emerge together or even switch energy functions and the configuration as a whole remains   
1:09:17   
completely stable no matter how complicated it becomes. And I guess that's true. I mean I'd like to see like   
1:09:25   
some simulations where you really try to break the tinsy structure. At some point   
1:09:31   
there must be a failure mode and you know it'd be interesting to know what that is but that you know that does   
1:09:37   
speak to like if you had something like cell division where you can change the   
1:09:43   
network you stretch it sometimes you break its continuity but it can recover   
1:09:49   
from Yeah. And um yeah breaking is good   
1:09:57   
sometimes. Yeah. Especially if you're cell dividing   
1:10:02   
or um even muscles, you stretch them. That's how you build more muscle mass as   
1:10:08   
you overstretch them. So yeah, you get you get disintegration of the   
1:10:15   
existing muscle mass and then it rebuilds. You get Yeah. Yeah. You overstrain it and you can   
1:10:23   
build more muscle. Yeah. So in summary, an appreciation of living   
1:10:30   
organisms as complex constantly changing multiscale energy frameworks that   
1:10:35   
continuously fall from one stable state to another maintain overall viability through their myriad homeostatic   
1:10:42   
processes is what we're talking. So this is really a lot um you know they kind of   
1:10:49   
lay out their theory here and how this this works. Um you know we just have   
1:10:54   
this minimal energy principle. So we actually do have, you know, I mean, you want to call it the free energy   
1:10:59   
principle, you can, but it's very similar to that idea. Um, and so it's   
1:11:05   
really interesting. Um, we're dealing with a complex system. We're dealing   
1:11:11   
with something that's uh self-regulating. We're dealing with something that's self-organizing.   
1:11:16   
We're dealing with something that exists at multiple scales of organization. And then we have this sort of   
1:11:23   
self-repair aspect where it can remodel and repair itself and with minimal   
1:11:28   
effort. So then in the discussion they talk about how there are these differences   
1:11:35   
between structural and functional theories. Um and then kind of you know   
1:11:42   
structuralism is is kind of separated from functionalism in ways. Um, and you   
1:11:49   
know, we ended up with, you know, these two distinctions between structural theories, functional theories of   
1:11:55   
biology. Um, and so now kind of they're bringing those together.   
1:12:02   
And, uh, you know, that's that's really what we need. And they talk about the   
1:12:07   
laws of biology as being also this thing needs to be kind of reconsidered in   
1:12:12   
light of things like tenacres. Um and they bring up this point   
1:12:19   
stability before mobility. So you know in order you know we think about like cell motility say as like a defining   
1:12:27   
transition evolutionary transition when things started to move around that's when you got a lot of interesting things   
1:12:33   
in in the history of life. So when you could have like a a predator chase after   
1:12:40   
a prey or a prey evade a predator when you had cell migrations or when you had   
1:12:45   
things moving and changing shape that's when things got really interesting. And so this is talking about um how things   
1:12:55   
are unstable. So the structure has to come before mobility. So you can't have   
1:13:02   
mobility without structural stability. Um and so um orthodox biomechanics has   
1:13:09   
tended to focus on mobility with stability as a secondary consideration   
1:13:14   
but it actually it's the other way around where you need to have stability   
1:13:19   
first and then mobility and mobility can catch up has to catch up to stability   
1:13:25   
rather than the other way around otherwise you have this uh intrinsically unstable system.   
1:13:32   
So this is where um you know they actually they talk about sort of the   
1:13:38   
movement of muscles and they talk about how you know what comes first the muscles or the neural system.   
1:13:44   
Sometimes you need to have the neural system um in order to sort of drive the   
1:13:51   
muscles. But yet we know that muscles can twitch on their own and have behaviors on their own. And we also know   
1:13:58   
that there's uh passive dynamic walking which you can achieve just purely by mechanical means.   
1:14:06   
So there's probably this aspect of muscle stability that exists   
1:14:11   
independently of the ner nervous system when the nervous system provides an input which provides the input of uh   
1:14:18   
enhanced mobility but you need the stability first in order to get to that.   
1:14:24   
Um and then they kind of so they kind of use a lot of examples from the human muscularkeeletal system and what we're   
1:14:30   
kind of interested in of course is cells but also maybe like you know other types   
1:14:37   
of muscularkeeletal systems. So it's interesting that they kind of use this analogy because um you know we're of   
1:14:44   
course actin is our analogy in the cell but also that we have we can think more   
1:14:50   
broadly about these closed chain systems closed chain kinematic systems and the homeostasis that drive superstability.   
1:14:58   
So I think that's enough for that paper but I think it's an interesting theoretical foray because they bring up   
1:15:05   
a number of concepts that are really really useful. No modeling though. No modeling.   
1:15:10   
Well, yeah. I would like to see them try to model that that Yeah, but they're probably trying.   
1:15:17   
Oh, yeah. I'm sure it's hard to do, I guess. Numeric. Okay,   
1:15:23   
so that's it for today. Um, thank you for attending and see you next
