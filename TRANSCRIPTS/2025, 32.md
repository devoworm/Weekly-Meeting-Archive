Hello. Hi. Hi. How are you? So, how's your any
0:07
research updates or anything like that? I think um the dean signed the form to
0:13
say that I could be on their digital system. So, I should be
0:18
have full access to libraries again and um get on with things like write a
0:25
paper. Um yeah, I had to outline what I was planning to do. So it's like write write
0:33
my paper about my thesis and then do animal
0:39
care course so that I can work with the axelottle eggs. Then I have to learn how
0:44
to run the optical coherence tomography equipment and then I can take images of
0:50
eggs. It's a lot of leadway going into it.
0:56
Yeah. So, he said, "I'm really busy this fall. I you know, how can I do this this
1:01
fall?" And I'm going, "Uh, well, I have to do all these other things."
1:08
So, no, it's not until the spring. And and so he liked that.
1:13
Good. When he's teaching, he doesn't want to do any extra projects, right?
1:19
Yeah. I understand that, right? because I've taught I understand.
1:25
Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so yeah, it looks like I
1:31
might be able to do that. It would be nice to get a baseline images of the developing blast to seal.
1:41
Yeah. Yeah. It' be great. Nobody's done it.
1:47
I keep telling them that nobody's doing this research. So at least not I can do
1:53
I can do a search but they number one they use xenopus and number number two
2:00
they they're not doing that. Huh? Okay.
2:05
This is the engineers and the biologists don't talk to each other, right?
2:10
Because there's there's a perfectly fine experiment done and xenopus.
2:17
Um anyways, it's um with optical quartz
2:23
tomography, right? They they looked at the movement of the
2:29
the layers inside the the egg. So,
2:36
I just need to duplicate that with the with the salamanders.
2:45
Well, that's great. Hopefully that that h that works out well and you get some good results.
2:52
Yeah. Well, at least and with animal care, if somebody's done it before, they
2:57
they're more likely to say, "Oh, yeah. This is this has been done."
3:03
on a slightly different species and it's good to compare species and
3:10
and then if I get a good paper that I can send it to the herptologists.
3:16
Oh yeah. Then maybe they'd like to do that with
3:22
some of their their what is it? Blue tailed skinks. Oh,
3:28
they grow in Manitoba. Moose blue tailed skink eggs.
3:35
Oh, yeah. All right.
3:41
So, that's great. Yeah. Thanks for the update. So, I went back after last
3:47
week's meeting. I went back and looked for a copy cell 3D methodology
3:52
because last week we talked about console and I found a paper that where they were
3:59
doing some things with embryos I believe or embryogenesis and I'm going to go through that and I'm
4:06
going to go through the methods and we can compare those with what we saw in console which was of course
4:13
implementing a mathematical model in a platform
4:19
and then Compy Cell 3D of course does that differently. So,
4:24
okay. It looks similar to Compell 3D though.
4:30
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we'll see what they do differently. I just wanted to put them
4:35
side by side and see. And this is a different system, but it's uh
4:42
you know it's it's I tried to pick well they they've done some stuff in development in copy cell 3D and now
4:49
they've done chick embryos and in this paper here and then there some more things on tissue regeneration which is
4:56
of course different but it has the same sort of things that you need to model.
5:02
So Oh okay. Yeah. I'm still interested in stress and
5:07
strain curves. Yeah. Or force force and change in distance
5:16
curves. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we'll see. I don't think they have any in this paper
5:21
either, but you know, looks like we have someone here. A
5:30
good morning.
5:37
I just saw I was just looking for webinars
5:42
that I could learn from my master student from stem cell biology in India. Okay. Uh, so
5:55
I'm sorry.
6:14
Okay. Oh. Well, that sounds like he's interested in things.
6:20
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Going to reconnect here in a minute.
6:27
Okay. Probably going to chase a fly or two. Okay.
6:33
This time of year.
6:40
Wait for him. Yeah. Yeah. I asked someone who knew about
6:47
console and they said, "Well, you have to make your um their trust structures
6:53
large enough to get a good mesh." And I'm going uh well, they're in micrometer
6:59
size, maybe kind of nanometer size. So, how am I supposed to get a mesh?
7:07
because they don't do um they do nanotech in the the solid mechanics but
7:15
they don't do it for trusses right yeah and the trusses are are supposed to be
7:23
self meshed like there's yeah I don't know
7:32
there's a lack of information just saying yeah Oh
7:37
yeah, why don't we get started with the paper? Um,
7:43
so this is the paper here. Um, this is called a mechanical model of early somite segmentation.
7:50
So this is from 2021. So it's fairly recent. And
7:58
yeah, yeah. Um, and then so the
8:04
graphical abstract, you know, they show what's going on here. So this is unsegmented epithelium.
8:11
This is the apical side. This is the basil side. There's this activation front. And there's this gradual increase
8:18
in apical contractility at up here going along the activation front.
8:26
Then this is the buildup of tension at cell junctions. So as the activation front uh continues down this the the uh
8:37
apical contractility uh causes this buildup of tension at cell junctions as you see here. And then
8:45
as the activation front continues on more almost to the end of the sheet then you start to get these separations at
8:52
breaking tension. So you get these segments that form. So you get this uh
8:57
apical contractility at one end. You get this buildup of tension at different junctions and then they break open and
9:05
separate at some breaking tension and you get these segments. So that's the idea here. So their highlights say a
9:14
dorsal presemitic meme misoderm of chicken embryos epithelializes before
9:19
somite formation. Dorsal epithelium shows signs of apical
9:25
constriction and early segmentation. A mechanical instability model can
9:30
reproduce sequential segmentation. And then a single ratio describes
9:36
spatial and temporal patterns of segmentation. That would be this here where you get these separations and
9:42
segments. And then this ratio which I'll talk in the paper describes this.
9:48
So this was published in eye science. So if we go into the uh summary
9:55
uh we start off. So miogenesis is often described using the clock and wavefront
10:01
model. So this is where you have the wavefront that we saw in the image with
10:07
a clock which is a temp timing mechanism. Um and this is of course a
10:13
famous model in developmental biology to describe differentiation and um so that's that's usually how we
10:21
describe smitoenesis specifically. However, this does not explain how molecular signaling rearranges the
10:28
presemitic misoderm PSM cells into somites. So these presymitic misoderm
10:34
cells we saw which were ahead of the wavefront are then you know being
10:39
rearranged into these somites. Our scanning electron microscopy analysis of chicken embryos reveals a
10:47
codally progressing epithelialization front in the dorsal PSM that precedes
10:53
somite formation. So this is again this uh
10:58
it it goes codally and it's moving um it's this front that you know of course
11:05
we saw in the image signs of apical constriction and tissue segmentation appear in this layer in layer 3-4
11:14
lengths of codle to the last form somite. So this is where we have
11:19
basically this uh localization of this apical constriction and tissue
11:26
segmentation. We propose a mechanical instability model in which a steady increase of
11:32
apical contractility leads to periodic failure of adhesion junctions within the
11:38
dorsal PSM and positions the future interwite boundaries.
11:44
So we get this sort of as the front goes along we have these mechanical
11:49
instabilities and this leads to periodic failures which give us these boundaries.
11:56
This model produces spatially periodic segments whose size depends on the speed of the activation front of contraction
12:04
which is parameter f and the buildup rate of contractility uh which is this symbol here. Um this
12:11
ratio which are these two the buildup rate of contractility over the front of
12:17
contraction determines whether this mechanism produces spatially and temporally
12:23
regular or irregular segments and whether segment size increases with the
12:28
front speed. So we have all these things that we're trying to figure out about it. What was that?
12:33
Um there's also a physical phenomenon that separates things into drops like a
12:41
long line of honey separates into drops. So there's also
12:47
um a surface tension phenomenon that helps
12:52
with a slight formation as well as perhaps this is um this is another wave
13:01
for instance. um that Dick keeps talking about. Um it's a wave of contraction
13:09
that goes down the um precursor spine to form the somites. But
13:17
there there is that phenomenon that breaks apart a line of um
13:28
I don't know honey is fairly uh dense
13:33
uh dense liquid. Um I should look that up. I've h I'm I'm forgetting what it's
13:39
called. So I'll I'd have to look it up. But um
13:45
so there's a surface tension phenomenon also. Okay.
13:50
It's in play. Yeah. Yeah. Examplified by like Morgan's
13:56
here. Hello Morgan. Good morning. Yeah. Good morning.
14:03
Uh so yeah so we start off with uh talking about somogenesis.
14:09
Soises and vertebrate development sequentially periodically creates metameic epithelial balls which are
14:16
these sommites along the elongating embryo body from the bilateral lods rods of loosely
14:23
connected messenymal cells called presemitic misoderm. So you see those that sheet of epithelial cells how
14:32
they're being kind of pushed apart by these forces and then they form these uh
14:39
sort of subsets of epithelial cells that then form balls and and like Susan said
14:45
this resembles uh drops of honey or you know basically
14:51
it results in these balls and so they kind of beat up um on this surface
14:59
as cells leave the roster anterior head end of the PSM to form each somite.
15:06
So rosterol interior is where you have head totail anterior being the head
15:11
restal being the tail and this is just kind of the but this is the head end. So
15:18
you have this end here um of of to forming some somite new
15:25
cells continuously move from the tailbud to join the PSM at the codal posterior
15:31
tail. So you have the roster on anterior which is the head codle posterior which
15:37
is the tail. That's the sort of the terminology. The anterior posterior is what we're used to in segans. Rostral
15:45
codle is what people like to talk about um you know in in anatomy as well and it
15:52
just depends on the convention people use. Uh but that's basically it. We're going axially and this front is moving
16:00
and and we're seeing this phenomena unfold in that way. Okay. At any given rostrocodal position,
16:07
a pair of uh nearly equalized sommites form simultaneously on both sides of the
16:13
neural tube between the ectoerm and the endoderm. So this is where we have these
16:20
nearly equalized somites and we have this pair happening at each position or
16:26
any given position. So the position is I guess uh random but you get these equalizes
16:34
forming at that position and then this is on both sides of the
16:40
neural tube between the ectoerm and the endoderm. These transient structures are the precursors of vertebrae, ribs and
16:46
many skeletal muscles. Many birth defects arise from a failure in one or more of these developmental steps. So
16:53
you get uh you know if you have these
16:59
these sort of somites they sort of form these different uh components where you have you know
17:06
they're num like in vertebrae you have of course different types of vert uh vertebra in the vertebral column you
17:14
have different numbers of them and so you have this sequence of things moving
17:20
down the body uh axially So this is important to get this sort of
17:25
mechanism in place where you can make these kind of repetitive depositions as it were of some thing
17:35
that you know some structure and development. Okay. So you know if we don't get this
17:41
to work right we get birth defects and they've listed them in this reference here.
17:50
Oh yeah. Rally plateau and stability. Yeah. Um I have in something I wrote um
17:59
the physics is rally plateau instability and it was also called capillary
18:06
thinning. Okay. Um so uh anyway I have a a paper on it.
18:16
Yeah. Okay. Oh, you you wrote it or did someone else write it? I wrote it. Yeah. Okay.
18:22
Part of um something that I needed to do for it was a final essay for a course.
18:31
I'm I prefer to write a small exam and then a big essay. I'm not into exams.
18:38
Okay. Yeah. Anyways, um
18:44
if I would you like to see my screen or Uh yeah we can let me do this. Uh you
18:50
can share your screen. Well you can share your screen. Yeah then.
18:56
Okay share screen. It's I think it's that.
19:11
Um okay that's not working. Okay. Window.
19:16
Oh, there it is. Um, here we go.
19:24
And this is a zebra fish developing. And these are some examples of this type of
19:31
phenomenon. And they tend to be periodic, okay?
19:37
A fairly regular period periodicity. Um,
19:43
and I have several uh references here.
19:48
Um, I don't know if I can pronounce that. Snow
19:55
at all. 2020. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, I did this with some honey one
20:01
time and Coman Luri used it in his publication and I just put a thin line
20:09
of honey on a piece of wax paper that Dix Dickens instructed me to do this and
20:15
it did change into a periodic structure like the bottom um part here.
20:22
Okay. So, there definitely is um this type of
20:29
instability that is naturally occurring. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
20:37
Just wanted to point it out because
20:43
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's great. Thanks.
20:48
Okay. So, let's see. Um and so if we look at
20:55
like some in terms of being robust to perturbation, it's striking strikingly
21:02
robust to perturbation, both spatial and temporal. Changes in the total number of
21:07
embryionic cells and the rate of new cell addition at the codal end of the PSM lead to compensating changes in the
21:14
size and timing of cellite formation so that the embryo eventually produces the
21:20
same final number of somites as in normal develop. So there's this sort of
21:25
compensation when things don't go the way they're supposed to or you know at
21:30
least to an extent because you can get um developmental defects
21:36
um a linear increase or scaling of the somite size at the speed of the codle
21:43
moving position of the termination front or with the rate at which cells join the
21:49
codle end of the PSM can result in this number uh
21:54
conservation. So this is you know again a number of internal mechanisms working uh to
22:02
regulate this models seeking to explain somite formation include the cell cycle
22:07
model which couples the timing of segmentation to the progression of cells through the cell cycle. So says we're
22:14
you know every time there's a cell division um you have this timing mechanism and u you know it corresponds
22:22
with the timing of segmentation uh along with a cell intrinsic gating mechanism. There also reaction diffusion
22:30
models which can be used for uh pattern formation. Um and so currently the most
22:38
widely accepted family of models employ a clock and wavefront mechanism which we talked about um which combines codly
22:45
pressing fronts of determination and differentiation with an intracellular oscillator which
22:52
determines sulfate based on its phase at the moment of determination.
22:57
uh following the identification of the first oscillating transcripts which is which are Harry 1 and Harry 2 and the
23:05
PSM. So this is the upregulation of um oscillating transcripts or transcription
23:10
factors. Uh and then many computer simulations of varying complexity have
23:16
implemented different CW models. So the clock and wavefront is driven by these two transcription factors and uh you
23:25
know you can model it at that level and get a timing mechanism and all that. Uh
23:30
most CW models reproduce the experimentally observed scaling of somide size with clock period front
23:38
speed and rate of elongation of the PSM. Okay.
23:44
uh recent experiments have shown that somite like structures can form without either a clock or a progressing
23:51
determination front. So you can get these sort of structures sort of without
23:56
these mechanisms and you can sort of get a model free account of this sort of
24:02
pattern formation. Yeah, maybe I that's what I just showed you. Uh perhaps this is uh Katrell 2015 and
24:09
Diaz 2014. So coderell 2015 is a local
24:16
self-organizing reaction diffusion model can explain somite patterning in embryos. This is using explicitly a
24:23
reaction diffusion model but a local self-organizing type. So I'm not I'm not
24:29
familiar with that but that would be the reference there that was in cell systems.
24:35
And then the Diaz uh reference this is uh with James Glazier on it. Um, somites
24:42
without a clock. So, this is, you know, uh, it's from 2014. I'm going to assume this is some sort of
24:49
like segue into the copy cell 3D. Yes.
24:55
Yeah. Uh, the ability of some lights to form without either a clock or a front suggests that we should consider other
25:00
mechanisms that could lead spatially and temporally periodic sequential division
25:06
of the PSM into regular segments. Recent experiments by Nellman's
25:13
show showed that applied tension along the rostrocodal axis can induce the formation of intraommitic boundaries in
25:21
locations not specified by CW signaling. This suggests that mechanical mechanisms
25:27
may be important in generating intraommitic boundaries. That's the the mechanical
25:33
uh mechanisms we saw in the diagram. Um me mechanical instabilities could
25:39
also result in vertebrate segmentation. Invertebrate segmentation assuming relaxation of junctional
25:45
adhesion sites as the PSM elongates. Their prepatterning mechanism generates
25:51
a number of sites independent of the final segmentation mechanism. Their
25:56
model however does not consider the sequential development of the boundaries
26:01
or any active processes within the tissue. So they're trying to work out a sort of
26:08
a I wouldn't say it's a model free model but they're basically trying to work you
26:14
know use copy cell 3D to investigate this type of organization in more
26:19
detail. So our observation showed that the dorsal PSM cells undergo early
26:26
maturation forming an epithelial monollayer along the ectoerm
26:32
beginning long before somite formation. The presemitic epithelium also shows
26:37
signs of pre-segmentation with clusters of cells forming arch tissue segments
26:42
roughly the length of a somite diameter. Those were those kind of those bundles that you saw in the um graphical
26:50
abstract. These observations suggest that periodic tissue segmentation and semi boundary
26:57
positioning could result from mechanical instabilities similar to periodic cracking of materials subject to stress.
27:04
Yeah. Yeah. We developed a model of the dorsal
27:11
epithelial monollayer where the observed boundaries between dorsal segments arise from the loss of contact between two
27:17
neighboring cells due to increased apical tension between cells.
27:23
We simulated this scenario with a 2D computational model of a cross-section of the epithelial monollayer and show
27:30
that a simple mechanical model without a clock can explain the spatial periodicity and segment sizes. We also
27:37
showed that this model can produce either roughly constant size segments or seg segments is size increases or scales
27:45
with activation front speed and inverse rate increase of apical contractility.
27:52
A critical threshold for the ratio of buildup um this rate of apical contractility to the activation front
28:00
speed defines the boundary between these two domains. So this is this ratio that we're talking about. The second
28:06
threshold for this ratio predicts whether this mechanism produces spatial or temporal
28:12
spatial and temporally irregular segments of or regular segments. So you
28:17
have regular do you have uh regular segments or irregular segments basically
28:23
and so this other this uh threshold for this ratio predicts that.
28:30
Okay. So I want to go down to okay so this is kind of uh maybe
28:36
a decent art sort of set of images to show this process in vivo. So this is um
28:44
this is early signs of presemitic epithelium segmentation. This is um electron microscopy showing
28:52
this process the dorsal here the vententral the roastrol the codle and so
28:58
you can see this sort of process happening. This is 100 microns. So you
29:04
can see this process happening um kind of from codle roster and how
29:10
this is working. So they show these sommites being 100 microns
29:16
uh about the size of this uh scale bar and then they show uh the PSM here S0
29:23
and S1 they so they show these two somites and then the presummitic uh
29:30
cells here. So actually it's rostrol to codle is where things are going. So this
29:36
is somite for already formed and then the rest of these uh cells down here
29:44
these epithelial cells are not uh organized in that way yet. So you see
29:49
that the organization is going. Okay. So then they just show the aspect
29:55
ratio here. These are the the organized
30:00
epithelial cells. So you can see that you can see the apical end there. And
30:06
then you can see this graph which is
30:11
you have cell pair and so different size cell pairs from rostro codle and then
30:17
you have side to side distance in microns and you see that you have these
30:24
this is s1 over s0 s2 over s1 s3 over s2 and you see how at the apical end and
30:32
the basil end you get these different side to side distances there's difference between them. Um, you know,
30:39
as we go from rostal to codle, the difference, I guess, gets smaller. I'm
30:44
not sure exactly how the trend is shaping out, but basically it replicates
30:50
what we saw in the graphical abstract. So, that's um kind of something to kind
30:58
of prove that this is uh kind of quantifiable and we can see this in
31:03
nature in vivo. Okay, so we have this mechanical model.
31:09
Um, and they kind of talk about some of the things here.
31:14
Um, this is the prop proposed models of segment formation. So these are
31:20
different uh, so a here is the epithelialized model or epithelialized
31:26
cells. So this is kind of the initial state. This is the model's initial condition where everything is stable.
31:33
You have the basil side, the apical side, you have rostro to codle organization.
31:39
And then this set of uh models here in B is this mechanical instability model.
31:45
This is what we saw in the abstract where you have the activation front moving down.
31:51
You have the gradual increase in apical contractility. Here you have this buildup of tension at cell junctions and
31:58
then the separation at breaking tension at different points. Then you have this cell clustering model
32:05
which is where you have the activation front again but this time instead of
32:11
having this uh apical contractility we have these random cell cell associations.
32:18
So we have apical contractility happening but they're parise instead of gradually down the uh sheet. And so you
32:26
get these cell cell associations, you get these groups of u of of epithelial
32:33
cells and then they start to uh have these separation points. So you get
32:39
these clustering, you get these separation points, you get clustering into larger cohorts and then you get
32:45
this separation point here which gives you a segment. Okay. So that's the uh cell clustering
32:52
model. Then the seeded activation is where you have different seeds where the cell is activated. It recruits other
32:59
cells through signaling. You have another seed which does the same thing.
33:04
And that kind of forms the segments from within because segments are only as long as the cells that are recruited by the
33:12
seated cell, the focal cell. And in between where those influences fall off,
33:17
if you think about it like uh gradients in a um reaction diffusion model, you
33:24
get separation where those gradients sort of intersect. And so that's how you get your so they have these three models
33:31
that they have proposed. Um and so then they say our mechanical
33:37
and stability model has three main parameters. F this as symbol and F break
33:43
or this break um parameter. So um we
33:49
have the tissue which is F the rate and that's what we refer to as the buildup
33:55
rate of contractility. Um and then um
34:00
the ma this uh let's see and there's a maximum tension the length between
34:06
adjacent apical domains of neighboring cells can sustain before the cell loses their connection with each other and
34:12
that's break. So it has this sort of the tissue itself the rate of buildup of
34:20
contractility and then this breaking uh threshold.
34:25
Okay. So this leads us to the cellular plots model and and of course copy cell
34:31
3D. So we implemented a stochastic cellular plots glazier grainer hogw
34:37
which is the sort of the basis for puppy cell 3D. Um this model version of dorsal
34:44
tissue segmentation. So this has been talked about in these different references here.
34:51
Um in this model the cells are spatially extended objects similar to the schematic cells um in figures 2A through
34:58
2D with a width and a height apical basil and core domains and elastic
35:04
connections between neighboring apical domains representing apical junctional adhesion domains.
35:11
We first characterize the model behavior for different fixed values um and then for simultaneous increase of
35:18
that fixed value in all cells at rate this rate here before exploring the
35:23
effect of a gradual codally progressing front f of apical constriction
35:28
activation. So the the front of the in the tissue is f this is just the
35:34
constant um that's going through the tissue.
35:39
Okay. So then uh we first tested our model by creating small epithelial monollayers fixed aspect ratio. Um we
35:49
increase the strength of our of apical contractility of all cell pairs simultaneously at a fixed buildup rate
35:56
uh to a maximum value uh ranging from 20 to 600 with without allowing apical
36:03
links to break. We then observe the shape of the tissue and the average cell pair attention over 20,000 simulation
36:10
time units. This is done through Monte Carlo. Um and then after our parameter
36:16
reached its maximum value. As the number of cells in the monollayer increases,
36:22
cell pairs in the middle of the segment experience higher tension than cell pairs near the periphery,
36:27
which you know maybe is expected because in the periphery it can it doesn't have these as much buildup. Um this
36:36
dependence on tension and position within a segment forms the premise of our model that is as the tissue becomes
36:43
larger tension between cell pairs increases. Since the junctional bonds between cells have a defined breaking
36:50
tension, higher local tensions predispose the tissue to break into smaller segments.
36:56
So this is kind of the setup here. This is um A is the snapshot of four
37:02
simulations of 10 cells. So we have these 10 cells here with different levels of maximum apical contractility
37:09
strength. The tissue becomes more constricted for larger values.
37:15
And then this so this is 20 this is 100
37:21
this is 300 and this is 600. And as you can see it's kind of like
37:28
this part here apical constriction is happening down here. So this is kind of being pulled inward and you see it's
37:36
almost like it's like a bowl by the time you get down to 300 and 600. Whereas in
37:41
20 it kind of looks like a long still looks like a long segment of cells. Um
37:48
and you get you know some limited apical constriction but not a lot.
37:54
Uh and then so we get we have B which is a plot of the average apical tension
38:00
between cell pairs at the end of multiple simulations of different numbers of cells. So this is where we
38:06
have our cell pairs here which goes up to 24 and then we have our tension which
38:12
is in negative values going down. So from -2,000 togative -6,000
38:19
and you can see this uh where you have for cell pairs it goes down maybe to
38:26
uh in most of their examples here the uh lowest tension is found at about 12 or
38:34
between 10 and 15 and then it goes back up. So you're uh you know you're
38:43
thinking about how many cell pairs are exhibiting the maximum tension and it's
38:49
basically this curve where if the cell there too many cell pairs you know the
38:54
tension decreases again then this graph C maximum tension and
39:00
the number of cells that is the maximum cell pair tension versus the number of cells in the tissue for different
39:06
maximal values. So I mean you can see this here and this is for these
39:11
different uh parameter values that we see in a. So as we go down to like 600
39:19
and 800 we get this uh maximum tension is decreasing and it's as much as any
39:25
other example. So the maximum tension is um you know going into larger negative
39:31
values as we go down to a larger number of cells. And then for 50 it doesn't
39:37
really matter because the whole thing it's basically zero maximum tension.
39:43
Uh for D we in DN we have a histogram of distribution of segment sizes and
39:49
normalized segment sizes for different rates of simultaneous buildup of apical contractility.
39:55
So this is where we have the buildup rate. Zoom in a little bit here. Um we
40:01
have the buildup rate which is this parameter and we have this for different parameter values. Um we can see that
40:08
there it kind of shifts as the parameter value decreases it kind of shifts to the
40:13
right. So the the segment size gets larger on average I guess and you know
40:21
it's it's going from like this. Well actually it's not really a
40:26
trend like that. That's kind of like 0.5 is here with a mean segment size of
40:32
about eight. Then they think this is 0.1 which has a mean segment size of four.
40:38
Then 0.025 which is the blue is a
40:43
segment size you know within it's maybe biodal around 14. So you can see that
40:51
kind of it's just showing the segment distribution frequency there for different values. And then for E
40:58
we have this broken out for these different parameter values. So we can
41:04
see that this is normalized segment size. We can see the shape of those distributions
41:10
there. Okay. So you know we're learning a lot from
41:16
this model. Um so this is not you know like in the case of our model in
41:24
that we ran in console last week there was a lot of mathematical modeling in
41:30
building an oilerian and then they were building a lrangeian representation of
41:35
space and they had this mesh that they then simulated everything with and they were showing this basic movement of
41:43
cells or the cell motion this invagination in heresy seeing this apical constriction and this formation
41:49
of patterns, but we're doing it in a little bit different way. We're using these cellular pots models which
41:54
basically model things at the level of cells and then they they exist in in an
42:00
matrix and then or in a in a in an array and then you can uh manipulate them and
42:05
measure these different features. So um the cells are you know interacting. So
42:12
you have the ability to simulate interactions between cells and that's
42:17
it's a little bit different model. Um and so they kind of get into some of
42:23
their results here. Um this is actually a nice figure four here where we have
42:28
this rostrocodal progression. We have these different uh separations
42:35
here that you see. So you actually get and this is where you know we saw
42:42
like I said earlier that it's kind of random but it's also regular at the end of the process. So this a is where you
42:50
get this time series simulation showing the sequential segmentation of a tissue
42:55
due to a linear increase in this parameter the cells progressively activate rostrol to codle. So this is um
43:03
where we get this uh you know these kind of divisions and then they kind of form
43:09
these clusters and then the cluster sort of align themselves to get this regular
43:15
um pattern here. So this is over time where you're getting this process down
43:22
the line and then it's forming these regular um clusters these regular
43:28
somites. Uh this just shows uh these graphs here, the tension versus time. So
43:36
you get these different cell pairs, different colors. This is the first segment. This is the second segment. So
43:41
you can compare the two. the first segment you get this decrease in tension
43:47
until you get to a certain point in time and then there's this uh I guess it goes
43:52
down in terms of negative tension and then up and then you get this it's a sharp transition here actually in this
43:59
case you have two three I guess two sharp transitions the first one that's
44:05
labeled in red and the second one's labeled in blue and then in this uh second segment you get the same thing
44:12
you get these two sharp transitions, but they happen a little bit later. And so
44:17
that's and then this is the tension for the first segment and the second segment
44:22
at in three different conditions. The red one is at rostral tear, the blue one
44:28
is at cautal tear and then black is at both tears. So this the tension varies.
44:34
I'd like to compare that with the rally plateau instability for the same
44:41
material. Yeah. Yeah. Be interesting. Yeah.
44:46
I'm I'm sure a living system changes the periodicity of of the segmentation, but
44:55
Right. Right. Yeah. It's going to be a lot Well, yeah. I mean, in simulation,
45:01
it's going to be a lot more idealized. So figure five is we have segmentation
45:06
as a function of activation front speed where we have this uh buildup rate we
45:12
have segmentation size on the y- axis and then front speed in terms of cells
45:19
um on the x- axis and so we can see the front speed is the front speed increases
45:25
we get a general increase in segment size here in A this is average segment
45:30
size as a function of front speed and in B we have average segmentation time
45:35
which decreases as a power law with this exponent here of the front. Uh each line
45:41
shows a similar behavior for different base values of the buildup rate of apical contractility. So you see in the
45:48
first one you see this um average segment size as a function of front speed and then the second one we have
45:54
this power law scaling in terms of segmentation time as a
45:59
function of front speed. Okay. So I did want to show this other
46:07
paper which describes um this kind of phenomena. This is a
46:13
different paper. This is way back from 1992. This is the brainer and glazier
46:18
paper. So this is um in physical review letters and it's called simulation of
46:24
biological cell sorting using a two-dimensional extended pots model. So this is where we have this biological
46:31
cell sorting. You can do this for all sorts of different phenomena. I mean basically pattern formation is about
46:38
cell sorting. Um and so you can do this in this extended pots model and this
46:43
describes sort of the physics behind this model. So this isn't just like you
46:48
know magic or boxes interacting. This is where we have some real physics behind this. So um in this paper uh you talk
46:58
about simulating the sorting of a mixture of two types of biological cells using a modified version of the large Q
47:05
pots model with differential adhesivity. We find longd distance cell movements
47:10
leading to sorting with a logarithmic increase in the length scale of homogeneous clusters. Sorted clusters
47:18
then round which is a complete sentence that was published in physical reviews.
47:23
Not sure what that means, but we find two successive phases. A rapid boundary
47:28
different creation of low cohesivity cell monollayer around the aggregate and
47:33
a slower boundary independent internal. So in this simulation they're kind of um
47:40
sorting things and they're forming this round shape and there these two phases
47:46
where you get this uh cell mono layer around the aggregate and then a boundary
47:52
independent internal rearrangement and so what they're using here is they're using a Hamiltonian
47:58
experiments have demonstrated the differences in inter in intercellular adhesivity determine the final state of
48:04
cell sorting the self configuration approach Approaching the global minimum of overall surface energy. Driving
48:10
forces can arise from differential surface energies. The differences of surface energy for boundaries between
48:16
like cell typesic unlike cell types heterotypic and cells
48:21
in the external medium or edge. So uh previous simulations of cell sorting out
48:28
so this was pre-1992 and another using other methodologies
48:33
either took cells to be pointlike or used non-realistic rules to describe
48:38
topological changes. So they're interested in topology of the cells.
48:44
However, cells have a non-trivial topology which must be simulated correctly if we want to understand cell
48:50
sort. So we need to understand the topology of this sorting process in
48:55
order to understand cells. Um there was there's an interesting paper um that in microgravity
49:04
um cells sort according to size. Yeah. Because of I guess different surface
49:10
tension um stronger surface tension if it's a small cell. I don't know. But yeah, they
49:18
they tend to clump according to the cell size. Yeah. And can disrupt an embryo.
49:25
In this respect, boundary and vert vertex dynamics models are preferable. The large qupots model has proved useful
49:33
in simulations of diffusive grain growth driven by surface energy. You can
49:38
correctly simulate experimentally observed top topological changes in cellular patterns in metals and soap
49:45
frogs. So you can do this sort of thing. You know, we have soap bubbles in a in a
49:50
froth or we have different patterns in metals and we can describe those using the large Q pots model.
49:57
Therefore seems a good starting point for a cell sorting model. However, cell sorting occurs through the movement of
50:03
cells rather than through cell growth. In addition, the POTS model simulates a pure material with single surface energy
50:11
while cell sorting requires the presence of at least two different cell types. So they're going to simulate cell
50:17
sorting in two dimensional aggregates using an extension of the two-dimensional pots model which
50:23
constrain cell size and allows for different surface energies between different cell types. So their model is
50:30
as follows. The large Q pots model describes a collection of n cells
50:36
defined by defining end degenerate spins. And so they they have that as
50:43
sort of a lattice site. A cell consists of all sites in the lattice
50:48
with a corresponding spin. So the physical version of this is a spin glass model and they're basically mapping this
50:56
to a biological system. Uh cells need not to be simply connected. Mismatch
51:01
bonds between different cells have energy one and bonds between like spins have energy zero. The Hamiltonian then
51:09
if we write that down is the pots Hamiltonian which is just basically the summation of
51:16
neighboring cells and then this uh this term here one minus this term and I
51:24
don't I don't what that term is it's referring to but in any case this
51:32
is this is the Hamiltonian that we're using. So um where the neighbors may be of any
51:39
desired range by either a square or hexagonal lattice. At each step we
51:44
select the lattice site at random and change its spin uh with Monte Carlo probability for a
51:51
temperature t greater than zero. Um and then we we have uh so we can have
52:00
change in the Hamiltonian which is the energy gain produced by some change. Uh
52:06
there is critical temperature TC above which each cell dissociates. Below TC
52:12
the spin coaleses into compact cells though for finite temperatures isolated mismatched spins are possible.
52:20
At t equals z the cells grow by relaxation as the pattern minimizes its
52:25
total surface area. The pattern's length scale increases as cells disappear. The
52:31
dynamics and statistics agree with well with experiments on surface energy driven ring growth such such as soap
52:38
froth. So they have this model they build it for soap froth and it's it's possible to see this. Okay. So that's
52:45
that's in a sort of a purely physical system. So in cell sorting we have a slightly different problem.
52:52
While the surface energy driving mechanism is the same as for green growth biological cells are generally a
52:58
fixed range of sizes. Thus the pattern cannot lose energy by coarsening since
53:03
cells cannot disappear and they can die but they can't disappear. Um and this is
53:08
something that we see in bubbles in magnetic films. Um, and so we're
53:13
constraining the evolution of this cell population. But instead of that, we look at
53:19
differences in contact energies between cells of different types, which we characterize as differential adhesion.
53:26
And this causes cell motion, which reduces the pattern's energy. To include
53:31
these ideas, we add an elastic area constraint to our Hamiltonian and introduce a second quantum number, which
53:39
is the cell type. So uh I think what we're getting is we're getting our spin
53:44
and that's corresponding the cell type or some characteristic of the cell. In
53:50
our simulations there are three cell types light, dark and medium and that's included in this term towel. The surface
53:58
energy between two cells then depends on the types of cells. So each cell still
54:03
has a unique spin and consists of all lattice sites with that of spin. But
54:09
there may be many cell cells of each type with the same towel. There is no
54:14
simple way to introduce the differential surface energies without the cell type. So then we write down the modified pots
54:21
model here. And this just shows the spin types the neighboring cells and that's
54:28
an additive term. Put that together into the sorting Hamiltonian.
54:33
And so then we can actually model this process. We then use pots dynamics with
54:39
one Monte Carlo time step defined to be 16 times the number of spins in the array. But we suppress the nucleation of
54:46
heterogeneous spins by requiring the lattice site flip only to spin belonging
54:51
to one of its neighbors. The constraint is biologically realistic for compact aggregates that we could relax it to
54:57
allow the nucleation of medium fil vacancies. We have checked that for our initial conditions. relaxing this
55:04
constraint makes no difference at t equals z only a negligible difference for t greater than zero.
55:11
So you know we have these um
55:17
you know different constraints uh you know they make different they make a difference.
55:23
Okay. So then you know they kind of walk through this model and they show kind of their results
55:29
and um this is actually they have a nice visualization for 1992
55:35
which is cell sorting. So this kind of shows how this model the output of this model um and so again you have these
55:43
cell types they're light and dark and kind of a medium state and you can see
55:49
them being kind of randomly distributed in these examples here at the top and
55:54
then in C and D you start to get this you know where the light and dark cells
56:00
coales or the medium cells coales into different groups. So you have this uh
56:05
coalesing of the black cells into these sort of patches and then you get more co
56:11
uh coalesing in D and then finally in E it becomes this blob within these other
56:18
cells and then finally in F you get this
56:24
uh sort of this you know inner cell mass and these cells around it. So you get
56:30
this sort of sorting into two circular compartments.
56:38
So that's how this Oh, sorry. I wonder how that fits in with the blastoil when we
56:45
Yeah. or um or a steroid or
56:52
Yeah. I'm not sure. Yeah. Anyway, it's quite become quite a
56:59
sophisticated model. I took the course. Yeah,
57:04
I could take it again. Like it was fun. Yeah. Yeah. I was learning how to program in Python
57:11
and learn the model at the same time. But yeah. Yeah.
57:17
Okay. So, I think that's enough for that. And I think that's they kind of contrast with the console work because
57:24
it shows that like there's this different set of assumptions that goes into the model, but you can model more
57:29
or less the same kinds of things. So it's just a matter of like picking your poison and seeing if it works. I don't
57:36
know how how did you try anything with like um tensities and compell
57:42
approaching that or what do you think? No. Um he said that 3D um comput was
57:50
difficult. Um and then they had another they were
57:56
working with someone to do 3D models. um I could look up what they called it and
58:02
he thought that maybe my 10 segreities might fit in with with that but um I'd
58:10
have to have learned a whole different um method of doing 10 seg and at that
58:18
point I didn't have time. So there are three or four different programs out
58:25
there that I would actually like to try. Actually, there's six of them. If you want me to name them,
58:36
one's called open foam. It's more of a um or fluids program, but in a way, uh
58:45
embryos are fluid. Yeah. So I don't know there there's lots of
58:52
research one could do on different programs for
58:57
um looking at tense in cells and I don't know which one would work better and
59:05
maybe none of them none of them would necessarily because um
59:11
tensities are unstable and um really so ourselves But they they're deterministic
59:19
and that they they um form a sheet and stay a sheet even if there's wobbles in
59:26
in the middle and it's not that your epithelial tissue is still intact. So
59:34
um yeah, it's sort of interesting. You're right.
59:39
Okay, one last feature before we go. Um so this is something that
59:46
um Hussein put in Slack and this is um this artificial life
59:54
software package called Vector Cosm. So this is it's kind of based on voids if
59:59
you're familiar with the voids paradigm where you have these collectively behaving agents and they have a YouTube
1:00:07
video that I'm going to walk through screenshots of and then show at the end the GitHub repository.
1:00:14
So this is a developmental update from May. This is called vector kosm. And so
1:00:20
uh each of these agents which are these little triangles
1:00:26
um they actually have their own sort of uh neural control their brain and to do
1:00:34
this they're revisiting spiking neural networks. So they're you know this is at the level of kind of public
1:00:39
understanding so it's not highly technical but they're basically using spiking neural networks.
1:00:45
They're using event driven spike neural networks. So only updates when it's needed and so um this reduces CPU time
1:00:54
and scale as well. Then they have these little they can identify local wiring patterns that are similar to like
1:01:00
connecttos or actual brains. The output adapters take samples of
1:01:05
neuron spike times to provide meaningful numbers. So you have this output layer that takes um things from the spiking
1:01:13
neural network and specifically neuron spike times and provides meaningful numbers to the output.
1:01:21
And so this is a real-time network mutation. So you can mutate parts of the network and get differential outputs.
1:01:29
And this is a continuous wiring pattern, cellular wiring pattern.
1:01:38
Now they said that networks are extremely efficient and this just shows the entire data structure needed for a
1:01:45
spike in neural network. So and and it's and the behavior that it produces. So
1:01:50
this is you know I don't know how many lines of code this is is pretty compact for something that you might expect to
1:01:56
be not so compact. So this is an example of the environment
1:02:03
here where you see the agents moving around. Um sometimes if there no input
1:02:08
signals, the agents don't exhibit any behaviors at all and they just kind of sit in place and that can be a problem
1:02:14
because you want them to move around. And so uh if the network flatlines, it
1:02:20
can't the agent can't motivate itself and so it can't act collectively and it just kind of sits there. They actually
1:02:27
have like this environment where the cells can or the
1:02:32
the organisms can interact. They go spike network organisms and they do
1:02:37
pretty well when working in contact with other spike network organisms like this.
1:02:44
Uh spiking brains are not meeting the level of refinement of regular brains. So we get spiking brains, we get a lot
1:02:51
of behaviors that are not like what we might see in regular organisms.
1:02:56
Um and This is another screenshot of the environment.
1:03:02
This is yet another screenshot of the network. And this is another shot of the
1:03:08
environment. And so finally, this is the uh GitHub
1:03:13
repository. Leavoya is the account and then Vector Kazm is the repository and
1:03:20
they have a release in this repository. It doesn't look like they have a license. They have a readme which kind
1:03:26
of goes over basics of you know the demo and the dev
1:03:32
build. Um then they have these instructions on how to clone the repository and build the program and
1:03:40
then you can use these different hotkeys to control the the interface that we saw in the screenshots.
1:03:47
And um so Vectorcosm is an AI aquarium for
1:03:53
digital life forms. It is a curious viewing experience in a science experiment in digital biology. Vector
1:04:00
Kosm runs as a clientside JavaScript app web browser. It creates a world made entirely of SVGs or scalable vector
1:04:08
graphics. Starting Vector Cosm will create a tank with random life forms or voids, plants and rocks. Voids will eat
1:04:15
food, grow, reproduce, learn and adapt. So they need to move around, do all these things. Vector Cosm also includes
1:04:23
a suite of automated AI training simulators you can use to help WDS learn basic life skills quickly. So they're
1:04:31
just kind of highlighting the spiking network, but there are other there are these AI training simulators
1:04:38
um that you can also use. So this is uh great work and if you're interested go
1:04:43
to that GitHub repository and get involved in that. All right. Well, I
1:04:48
think that's all for today. Um, all right. Yeah. So, thanks for attending and I'll see you next week.
1:04:57
Okay. Thanks. Yeah. Take care. Bye. Bye.
