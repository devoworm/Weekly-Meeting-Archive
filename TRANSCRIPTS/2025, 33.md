All right. So, welcome to Divorm this week. Um, we haven't had a regular meeting few
0:08
weeks. Uh, but today I'm going to talk about uh the artificial life 2025
0:14
conference. I'm going to go over some of the highlights and uh you know just kind
0:19
of talk about what they did this year uh and maybe how that might benefit people.
0:27
I'm also going to revisit some uh topics that we've talked about in meetings
0:32
past. I've been going through different meetings uh our archives and I've been
0:37
looking for common themes. That's what I often do is try to discover themes so we
0:43
can revisit them perhaps produce papers or talks or whatever. So that's what
0:48
we'll do today. So this is the website for a life 2025. The theme was ciphers
0:54
of life. So this was held in Kyoto, Japan plus online. So some of the talks were online but most of them were in
1:00
person in Kyoto. Uh there is a proceedings I didn't want to go through it because it's like 200 pages but the
1:07
proceedings are available for free on the website. So these are the
1:12
proceedings. It's 879 pages. Um and kind of goes through all of the organizers
1:19
and program committee and all this. And then uh you know there are all sorts of papers on cellular automa
1:27
robotics genetic algorithms different types of artificial life
1:33
platforms um also there's embodiment
1:38
um all sorts of things and so this is diversity great diversity of papers
1:46
available. So if we look at the program, uh there were several keynote speakers.
1:54
Um there was Hector Zenel who does algorithmic information theory. Um and
2:00
he's talking about u the title of his talk was common
2:05
misconceptions of computability and algorithmic complexity a new old framework for causality living systems
2:12
and scientific explanation. There is Blaza Ger de Arcus does
2:17
artificial life and artificial intelligence and are they really artificial?
2:23
There is also the artificial artificial life and art panel uh by Dr. Ekadami. Uh
2:30
they usually have an art um feature every conference. Sometimes it's like an
2:38
a keynote this time it's a panel and so you know they're talking about different
2:44
ways you can make uh artistic media with a life with evolutionary algorithms with
2:52
different types of adaptive programs and uh that sort of in this case uh they're
2:59
talking about the lineage of a life and generative sound. So this is you know
3:04
it's a tool that's been used um a wide range of artistic pursuits. Uh
3:11
this is the artificial life institute panel zen philosophy morality and
3:16
artificial life and their roles in organic alignment of AI. So this is where
3:23
uh they're trying to apply the philosophies in Zen Buddhism and plurality to build a roadmap to
3:28
coexistence with AI rather than domination or hierarchical control. And
3:34
then is it possible to evaluate alignment with these philosophies and AI safety research? So this is uh what
3:41
we're talking about here. Um so all sorts of different workshops
3:49
mortal agents and a life physical psychological and social death in the machine. This is social and
3:56
environmental good societal outreach. Goal directed behavior and living and
4:02
non-living systems. Emergence and evolution of language and communication.
4:08
Matter information interplays, goal directedness and meta system transitions.
4:14
This is tonal 2025 which is thriving on noise and artificial life. So this was all about noise and its role in
4:23
cognitive science and artificial life. There's chemo life forms which is the
4:28
fifth workshop on chemistry and artificial life forms. Making time two temporality and natural
4:35
and artificial systems. Planet X or the cultural evolution of Planet X. Emerging creativity in the
4:43
wisdom of crowds. Performative AI human machine agency.
4:48
Generative artificial life. Simulation of real world computation.
4:53
ABM hope workshop which is on agent-based modeling. SBA10 which is self-organization
5:01
and nano and electric mechanical robots towards the robosphere and then a life
5:07
and organizations navigating societal transitions through co-creation.
5:13
This one is interesting. I don't know if they have a description of it beyond the
5:19
there's the workshop website. So this is basically about sort of this open-ended
5:24
cultural evolution and sort of the whatifs and and possibilities of cultural evolution perhaps in other
5:31
planets. Um we are interested in the relationship between biological and
5:36
artificial cultures. Can the cultural models evolved in robot swarms produce a
5:42
plausible model for animal systems? Um, how c can insights from how culture
5:47
evolves in animal systems then in turn help us harness cultural evolution as a tool for learning and creativity of
5:54
robot swarms? So, their interest is um, you know, just kind of focusing on robot
6:00
swarms. Uh, but there are all sorts of different ways that we can think about cultural evolution including vocal
6:07
learning, nest building, tool manufacturing use, foraging behavior,
6:12
and of course movement. uh and there all all sorts of different uh aspects of culture that they'll focus
6:19
on. It's like transmission biases, cognitive transformations, social
6:24
structures and processes. If you go to the workshop website, there's a big focus on open-ended
6:30
cultural evolution and in this case developmental complexity and cultural environments. This is another
6:37
interesting one. Tonal or thriving on noise and artificial life. Um their
6:42
interest is exploring randomness and artificial life. Our central conjecture is that the role of randomness and noise
6:49
is vital and irreplaceable. From stochastic mutations that fueled natural and artificial evolution and chaotic
6:57
dynamics in numerical models, inherent unpredictability often lies at the heart of emerging complexity.
7:03
So this is where just considering the different sources of randomness in artificial systems in living systems.
7:13
Um and so you know thinking about the mechanisms by which random variation
7:19
generates novelty and creativity, strategies for maintaining robustness amidst chaos,
7:26
the flexibility achieved by the presence of beneficial variable noise and perturbations.
7:32
sources of intrinsic randomness and natural or artificial systems. The history and present of the edge of
7:38
chaos and self-organized criticality debate. That's an interesting uh kind of
7:45
historical debate about how self-organization proceeds and how you
7:52
know if things can exist on the edge of chaos that is quasi order in systems
7:59
that can also exhibit chaotic features. Then there's the role of noise in enabling greater integration of
8:06
alignment and functioning across scales. And finally the techniques for introducing controlled stochasticity to
8:13
achieve open-ended evolution. And this of course is the program. So
8:20
you know there are a number of talks on neural noise creativity and learning
8:26
driven self-organization noise and multiscale alignment
8:31
indeterminism and large language models. Just stochastic switching promotes open-endedness and sparse random boolean
8:39
networks. Another kind of clay intelligence is shaping of intrinsic noise.
8:46
Uh and then an open discussion. So this is interesting stuff. Okay. So let's start with this example.
8:52
This is rule hunt. Uh this is something that was produced during one of the
8:58
hackathon sessions at the awife conference. This is a symmetric solar
9:03
roma explorer and the idea is that you can distribute your explorations
9:10
and collectively amongst players on the internet find rules for cellular automa.
9:16
I guess that's what's going on here. Um so you know we can set up a simulation.
9:21
We can set up a random patch 10 x 10 random patch
9:26
and we can run it and see we have some patterns here being generated. These have gone extinct.
9:33
We can change the number of live cells.
9:38
Let's try that. So, you know, you have to play around with the parameters to get some interesting results.
9:47
Random seed is full grid. Random patches like that. The center seed is why you
9:52
have one cell that's active.
10:02
Okay. So, this is their uh GitHub repository. Um,
10:11
a couple people were involved in this um as contributors and uh so this was just
10:17
kind of put together at the hackathon. Uh so this is a distributed exploration
10:23
of the vast universe of cellular or automa worlds. Rule Hunt is a web-based platform for
10:29
discovering interesting patterns in the combinatorial space of 2D cellular automa. Uh they're building a Tik Tok
10:37
style interface where visitors can contribute their devices computing power to explore and catalog fascinating rigid
10:43
behaviors hidden in the two to the 512 possible rules. And so um you know the
10:51
hackathon theme for this year was exploration of emergence and complex systems. core topic in a life research.
10:59
Well, we're not exactly on the theme. Uh they're more about exploring the space of rules than emergence per se. This is
11:06
what we were excited to build. Sometimes the best hackathon projects come from following your curiosity rather than the
11:13
rubric. Um so this just kind of explains Conway's game of life and how that's
11:20
basically what you're trying to implement in this uh in this interface.
11:27
And so the idea here is that you have this vast number of possible neighborhoods.
11:33
Um, and so they're basically reducing the space with C4 symmetry. So many of
11:40
the 2 to the 512 rules are fundamentally identical. They just differ by our
11:45
rotation. So these four neighborhoods down here as an example should arguably
11:50
produce the same result if we don't care about the relative orientation of the game grid. So these four neighborhoods
11:57
are all equivalent mathematically. The C4 symmetry group consists of four
12:02
rotations that are at 90Â°. Under these transformations, the 512
12:08
neighborhoods partition into 140 equivalence classes called orbits. uh by
12:14
requiring our rules to respect C4 symmetry, we reduce our search space to 10 the 42nd possible symmetric rules,
12:22
which is still large, but you can explore this through this uh distributed
12:28
computing pyramid. So they just kind of go through how this works
12:34
and what kind of what they want to do for the future. Um it's typical
12:39
hackathon stuff. I think it's very interesting. So that's that's you know the kind of thing people do at a life
12:45
they explore cellular or automa but there are many other things that uh people talk about there and are
12:51
interested in. So that brings us to Mike Leven's keynote. Uh so Mike Leaven was uh one of
12:58
the keynote speakers this year. Um and he has a post on forms of life forms of
13:03
mind and um you know this is his talk here. talks about uh a robot scientist
13:12
which is a translation tool between diverse intelligences. So um the idea
13:18
here is that um there's this process of scientific discovery that adds an active
13:23
inference loop into it where you have a robotic agent on one end and a scientist
13:30
on the other that can um sort of supervise it I guess. Um there I was
13:36
also kind of including a gental materials into this talk. So um this was
13:42
uh I didn't intend the talk but you know it was u in that area of his uh you know
13:50
he's given a lot of talks on it. Uh and this is of course in consultation in collaboration with Josh Bongard. Um this
13:57
is the ICDO project which is this institution institute for
14:03
computationally designed organisms. Um so this is
14:09
the things that they're doing with xenobots. So this is a Z wife keynote talk uh the
14:14
embodied mind of a new robot scientist. Um and then this just shows like
14:21
some of the things that they're getting at with this talk.
14:27
Okay. Um, so that was interesting as well and and there are a lot of themes in his work that kind of come out of
14:33
this talk. So why don't we get into some of the screenshots? Um, the Roki Sama on
14:40
blue sky uh was one of the main people who is uh putting
14:47
out a lot of these screenshots on social media. Thanks to him for doing this and
14:54
kind of covering the conference, covering all the different things that were going on at the conference. There were a lot of things in the both in the
15:00
workshops and in the main sessions that were interesting. Uh so this is uh another uh cellular
15:08
automio using critical neural uh cellular automa
15:15
for reservoir computer. So this was um you know some of that work there. This
15:21
was Christopher Kongugo who used 3D units to capture patterns in the game of
15:27
life. So another cellular automa study where people are exploring these different rules and their results.
15:38
This is Petro Miati proposing differential logic cellular automa. So there are a lot of uh different types of
15:45
cellular automatous studies. Uh the the conference is very rich in that. It
15:50
looks like what they're doing is they're doing a lot of the differential cellular automa work. I think we've talked about
15:58
this work before. This is like kind of uh related to the neuroscellular automa
16:04
work uh as well as the differentiable cellular automa work. And there's a 2021
16:10
paper from um the still uh journal which is uh kind of a kind of the place you
16:19
would go to look at. It looks like some of these examples were kind of taken from that paper or inspired by that
16:25
paper. Um so that's you know that's all very interesting work.
16:31
Um this is uh ITK non blue sky um
16:37
introducing us to his computational framework of bio inpired adaptive systems using social allatic principles.
16:46
He followed up his model showing empirical testimonials. This is work on
16:51
elostasis actually and um there were a couple uh pieces of work in the
16:57
conference on elastis and This is interesting.
17:05
Uh this is uh Marco uh exploring the space of flow
17:11
millennia. So this is based on flennia. This is a uh we talked about this paradigm I think maybe last year
17:19
sometime late last year where uh it's actually the lenia platform and then
17:25
there are different versions of lenia. So there's regular Lennia, there's Flow Lennia, there's some other versions of
17:31
Lennia where people can use something that's it's not a not quite a
17:38
a cellular automa. It's this um it's this open artificial life platform
17:46
that allows you to explore um behavior and
17:52
other aspects of artificial life. This was this person was from the flowers AI
17:57
and cognitive science lab at Enria in France. So it's that's I'm glad to see
18:04
they're representative.
18:15
This is uh Nathaniel Virgo. And so Nathaniel Virgo I guess so uh AIFE 2025
18:21
was hosted in Japan. There's a whole group of people in Japan doing a life.
18:26
Uh one of the groups uh is the uh
18:33
one of the groups is the cross lab and Nathaniel Virgo up until recently had
18:38
been affiliated with the cross lab and so um he's done a lot of stuff on
18:44
uh different types of adaptive systems. This is where he's talking about a good
18:50
regulator theorem for embodied agents. This is of uh particular interest to our
18:56
group because you know we're interested in embodied agents and we're interested in the good regulator theory. So this is
19:02
uh some of his notes on this this idea. So let's zoom in a little bit here. Um I
19:10
think right now he is somewhere uh I think at University of Herford Share in England. Uh so that's uh where he is
19:17
right now. But this is uh where he's kind of coming up with
19:25
uh some ideas about using information theory and other types of tools to look
19:31
at embodied agents. And in thinking about the ever regulator theorem, here's the famous diagram where you have the
19:38
mapping between the model and the world and then this domain which tries to
19:44
approximate this target domain on a domain of the world. So Z is the domain
19:50
of the world, G is the domain, the target domain. The model um R is trying
19:58
to approximate that from system S. And so you know this is the diagram that
20:04
Ashb drew out in the Conanton Ashby paper. And uh then we also have this of
20:11
course quote every system that is a good regulator of itself must have a model of
20:16
its environment. And so this is actually he makes the connection with the notion
20:21
of meaning and inactivism. So interesting stuff there and kind of related to uh you know thinking about
20:29
the good regulator theorem and kind of bringing it forward into modern um
20:36
modern artificial life research.
20:42
Okay, this is Bla1 Aaric Earus and this he's showing a live demo of his famous
20:49
brain [ __ ] experiment. So this is a famous experiment in
20:55
uh programming languages. So brainfuck is an exotic programming language
21:00
invented by Urban Mueller in 1993. uh
21:06
it uh takes its name from a union of two English words brain and [ __ ] It plays
21:12
on the words since the language is deliberately simplistic because the expression brain [ __ ] evokes in slang
21:19
that which puts the brain in a state of confusion by its apparent complexity. So
21:24
that's uh kind of the background here. So, we've talked about this in our
21:29
Saturday morning meetings um and how that's kind of a benchmark for
21:34
intelligence. There's this book, what is intelligence? And uh this is Blaze here and this is
21:41
the simulation nonetheless. Okay, so this is complexity kit on blue
21:47
sky and um they also put out some posts
21:52
showing some of the things going at the conference. Um this is the synthetic biology artificial intelligence
21:58
workshop. Antonio Flores explains the concept of the robosphere, a complex of
22:04
self-organizing multiscale robotic ecosystems capable of autonomous adaptation and interaction with life
22:11
from nano to macro. So this is uh slideshow here. What is the robosphere?
22:18
We're talking about that and uh you know so the robosphere can be defined as the
22:24
totality of integrative ecologies of human and robotic agents interconnected
22:29
in or interacting across different scales from the nano to the macro within
22:34
the planetary system. This is uh George Muser also on Blue Sky kind of talking
22:41
about uh the Blaze uh Blaz's talk um on
22:47
brain [ __ ] and this is kind of getting at uh something that happened in the talk
22:53
here. Evolution has an arrow of time towards greater complexity. It's driven
22:58
neither by mutation nor by crossover sex but by symbiogenesis.
23:04
Um, and so this is following what Lin Margalles was talking about when she talked about symbiosis in u ukarotic
23:13
cells. And so as sort of evidence for this, Bla1 showed lots of cool core
23:19
warlike competing programs. So these are the core war programs running and demonstrating this this principle of
23:26
symbiogenesis. This is complexity at CAD again. How can
23:32
the physics of the game of life be modified to create extended non-equilibrium conditions? What new
23:37
structures could be created with these changes? Can brain water addresses these questions showing self-organization and
23:44
phase transitions and driven cellular automa? Uh so this is again more
23:50
cellular or automa work where they're showing off uh different you know kind of basically order from randomness
23:58
that you can produce through the game of life and through uh what they call a
24:03
driven game. This is complexity cat once again. Um I start the last day of a life
24:11
2025 with the cellular automa session where Matias uh bound uh Barand
24:19
presents his work on physical reservoir computing. His approach allows us to explore new diverse structures and
24:25
graphs all over and so this is uh sort of what they're
24:31
trying to produce here through reservoir computing. So reservoir computing
24:36
is what they're using physical reservoir computing is a large container of random
24:42
nodes and the idea is that through training you can shape those nodes into a network that describes
24:49
uh what you're trying to uh produce. So you're leveraging the intrinsic dynamics
24:56
in the physical system and you can use a number all sorts of dynamical systems as
25:02
a reservoir and then you end up producing these developmental graphs some automa
25:09
and then you end up producing these uh physical structures linear loosely stranded and other this
25:16
is Elias Njaro on blue sky Um
25:24
and he's of course known as the maintainer of the neural developmental programs GitHub repo repo that we've
25:31
used in our group. Um so of course he's on the panel here of the Sony session
25:38
and uh basically this is a discussion on how we can rethink intelligence under
25:43
the complexity lens. This is a screenshot of rule hunt which I just showed at the beginning of the uh
25:51
presentation. This is a screenshot of flow lineia. So I showed earlier flow lennia. This is where you have the like
25:58
uh the interface for that. Uh this is the introduction slide for social
26:04
analasis or how I learned to stop worrying and love the noise.
26:12
Uh this is a screenshot from the talk. um on differentiable cellular automa. So
26:19
this was you know these are the different things you can produce uh using logic gates. A lizard you have
26:26
522 gates uh Google logo 927 gates and
26:31
my color checkerboard 465 gates.
26:37
This is the 3D unit architecture and hyperparameters. Have a closeup of that.
26:45
This again is differential logic cellular automa. So they're actually using of course logic gates to
26:52
differentiate between different parts of a pattern. So you can see that there's
26:57
uh step n which is kind of a a weirdly misshapen lizard and then you have eight
27:05
channels a perception kernel perception vector and update circuit and then you
27:10
get the updated step which is a more refined wizard.
27:17
This is a closeup of developmental graph cellular automa. So this is where you
27:22
have your initial graph, you have a neighborhood, you have this uh action network, you
27:32
have this uh restructured graph with neighborhood information, and then you
27:38
have your final graph here. So that's that's their kind of take on development
27:44
and developmental graphs. This is uh I don't remember what talk
27:50
this was from but this is where they're producing avalanches in the cellular
27:56
automa and this is evolving towards criticality um where the goal of the fitness
28:03
function is to produce power law a power law distribution of avalanches. So the idea is you're you're evolving the
28:10
cellular automa and the fitness function is enforcing these kind of this power law distribution of avalanche events.
28:17
And so the avalanche events basically are these cascades of activations across
28:24
the cellular auto. This is physical reservoir computing
28:31
again. So this is a closeup of the slide that they showed there.
28:38
And this is of course the flow lineia talk. Uh this is where exploring flow
28:44
lineia universes with the curiositydriven AI scientists discovering diverse ecosystems.
28:53
And so this is from the uh socialistasis talk. Uh the question here is how do
28:59
systems maintain stability in unpredictable environments? uh and this can be a wide range of
29:05
interacting systems such as biological, artificial, individual and social
29:11
systems. This is of course going back to the 3D
29:17
units uh talk. This is uh leveraging 3D units for the recognition of emerging
29:23
patterns in this game of life. These are the structures produced um
29:32
by the developmental graphs. So these are linear structures, loosely stranded
29:37
structures and other types of structures.
29:43
This is again the reservoir computing talk. This is more flow line.
29:51
This is this book what is life/intelligence?
29:57
This is another uh screenshot from the socialistasis talk more on like signal
30:03
transducers as information encoders. So you have environmental/social noise
30:10
and adaptive signal and the resulting reconfiguration of internal states and
30:15
parameters. So this is just kind of talking about how this process works.
30:24
This is the good regulator uh diagram here. I thought this was really
30:29
interesting sort of the way that uh it was defined. This is of course from Conet Nashby.
30:36
This figure their definition of good regulator involves a good set. In our case, this will be the subset uh of good
30:44
states. So this is where you get you know this definition in the good regulator theorem of something that's
30:50
good which is you know of course you know you could uh that's shorthand for
30:55
maybe something like something that conforms to a fitness function or something that's a certain range of
31:02
optimality or something that is functional versus non-functional. So there are different ways you can define
31:08
good but of course the idea is you want to get to this G within Z. So Z is all
31:15
states, G are all the target states or the good states. And so that means that
31:20
you have to have a good set of solutions or a subset of solutions. So this is uh
31:25
you know we're going to be coming back to this because um the uh you know we're
31:32
doing one of our research groups our say renetic research group is doing uh research on the good regulator theorem
31:39
and really kind of pulling that apart and thinking about it in terms of like how it relates to intelligence and how
31:46
also it relates to embodied systems although we're not really interested in necessarily in an activism and things
31:52
like that.
31:58
This is another screenshot from Nathaniel Furo's talk on the good regulator theorem. Our theorem could
32:04
also be stated as every system that is a good regulator of itself must have a
32:09
model of its environment. Again, the definition of the ever good regulator theorem is that every good regulator
32:16
should be a model of a system or like a good or optimal model of that system. So
32:22
the idea is you have a model of a system. A system exists in the world and
32:27
a model is created of that system and that model should be good in the sense
32:32
that it captures all the relevant information of the system. And so the good regulator is something that has a
32:40
good model and then interacts well with its envir system or its environment to
32:45
capture changes and then that's that representation is good and um so Ashb
32:52
was I guess interested you know kind of the language there is a little bit vague
32:58
because they're always talking about a system but the system could be anything it could be biological it could be
33:04
social it could be any kind of system in the world and the idea is that you know
33:10
you're talking about this very general regulation. So anything in the world will have a model and then that model
33:16
will have like uh you know be able to capture some of the changes but of course you know we're talking about a
33:23
wide range of different types of systems. So it's hard to really get a fix on what exactly are the details and
33:29
sometimes you know social systems and biological systems have different properties where those models you know
33:35
how those models are updated and things like that. So, if we're talking about like uh social system, uh if we're
33:43
talking about an intelligent agent versus if we're talking about a biological system where there's not
33:48
necessarily an intelligent agent, does updating of that model proceed in
33:54
the same way or does that system have the capacity to build a model? We're
34:00
playing around with some ideas in terms of putting an observer into this loop. And so u we actually in our archive
34:07
preprint that we have on this um you know and I'll point you to this in the notes of the YouTube video um this
34:15
actually has an interesting set of properties that are beyond this definition.
34:23
So this is more reservoir computing. This is where we have a flattened representation
34:28
plus a neural cellular automa. we have this linear SVM and then class
34:33
prediction. So they're just kind of showing like using reservoir computing to you know testing out with an NCA
34:41
using MNIS classification. It's a very simple classification benchmark um using NCAs and reservoir computing
34:49
together to make those predictions. These are configuration graphs. These
34:54
are from a war neighborhood and a cellular automa just showing like how
35:00
different configurations which are living connected cells can be
35:05
represented in a in a graph or in a cellular auto. This is talking about
35:12
criticality and how this is useful for reservoir computing. So this is a reservoir
35:18
computer. This is the reservoir here. all these random nodes that get connected from input layer information
35:25
and then when they get connected then it produces an output layer that is not as
35:30
predictable as you might have if you had like a well-trained network. So this is a fixed connection and this is a
35:37
trainable connection in the dotted lines. So the fixed connections are things we already fixed from the input
35:44
layer. uh and then the dotted lines, the trainable lines are things that form
35:50
from the input layer to the reservoir and then of course from the reservoir to the output layer. And so their point
35:55
here I guess is that because of the structure that you have here, you have criticality that's possible where you
36:03
know you can have these sudden changes that happen. Okay. So one of the reasons they're using the Ever regulator theorem
36:09
in the Ever regulator theorem talk was that they want to uh be able to
36:15
reconcile a number of traditions uh for looking at intelligent systems
36:23
using information theory or not using information theory. So you know there's
36:28
the analysis of dynamical agents uh there's semantic information there's as
36:34
if contingency the free energy principle and integrated information so a lot of
36:40
things revolving around active inference and dynamical systems and uh different
36:48
types of concepts of agency and so they want to kind of do you know work on kind
36:54
of unifying all those approaches um and but they don't necessarily know
37:00
how to approach evaluating information in an a aential system. So they say we
37:06
want to do something similar but we don't just want to know which information is meaningful we want to
37:12
know what it means. So they want to have some accounting of the semantics or of the meaning and it's what they in one of
37:18
the previous slides they said this is consistent with the concept of meaning from um
37:25
from an activism. Okay. So we don't use information theory for this although perhaps in the future we will but
37:32
instead we present a theorem which is the regulator for it.
37:38
And then finally this is where uh this talk on social anastasis
37:43
where uh this is from Schulen 2011 where they make the distin distinction between
37:50
make the distinction between homeostasis and allostasis. So um and then adding
37:57
the word social. So this um definition is the social environment contains
38:03
useful information with further adaptation. And so this just shows the environment
38:10
and the agent and how you get these perturbations that change the agents
38:16
internal state relative to the environment. Okay, so that was u a 2025.
38:22
It look really interesting. Uh let's talk about a few other things before we go. So I was revisiting some
38:28
ideas from our previous year's activities. One of these was in a talk that I found from 2016. This is
38:36
following up in this work that we've been doing with um like lineage trees
38:42
and differentiation trees and thinking about morphogenesis and these uh these models that were in
38:50
this talk uh that I was just pulling things out of was it was something
38:56
called polygonals I guess would be the word. Okay, so it's this thing called polygonicals. And so this is something
39:03
that we're working on way back when and this is the idea where over time we can
39:10
use these uh abstract shapes and we can partition these shapes and we can then
39:16
use uh uh oiler pads to analyze them. So the idea here is you have these these
39:24
polygons that you partition internally and then you evaluate those partitions for viability by them following an oiler
39:32
path. And an oiler path is where I can take um each edge of this uh compound
39:38
polygon and I can draw a line through it once and only once. So in other words,
39:44
each line I should be able to draw or each edge I should be able to draw a line through once without drawing a line
39:51
through any edge twice. And so if I can do that, it satisfies the criterion of an oiler path. If not, that uh compound
40:00
polygon has an incomplete oiler path and it's nonviable. It's a way to look at partitioning
40:06
within embryos and partitioning within uh biological vesicles and cells that
40:14
describe sort of its optimal shape, its optimal partition. And so this is
40:20
something we've been working I've been work we've been working on this uh over the course of the D.VARM program. So
40:27
this was kind of something that emerged in 2016 and we kind of worked on it uh
40:32
across since ever since. And so um we haven't really I can't point you to a
40:38
paper on this because never really put it into a paper. It's one of these things that's pretty far out there and
40:44
it's pretty theoretical. So it's hard to really kind of get a good publication out of it. But perhaps to write
40:49
something up by the end of the year for that. So finally I wanted to talk about
40:55
a a range of biohysical topics. Um so
41:01
this goes back to a set of social media posts by Schwarz who's a biophysicist in
41:07
Germany. Um and so he was doing this really interesting
41:14
analysis of uh sporzoes and how they
41:19
kind of transport in an environment. So sporzoites are these malaria parasites
41:26
and they're interested in looking at their collective migration and the mechanical flexibility of the
41:33
sporzoites. So plasmodium sporzoites are the crescentshaped forms of malaria
41:38
parasites injected from the salivary glands of mosquitoes into the skins of their vertebrate hosts. So that's and
41:45
then this is the paper that um is talking about elective migration reveals
41:52
mechanical flexibility of malaria parasites and meth in nature physics
41:57
from 2022 and so here's some example of the sporzoites
42:02
and they they exist in these vortices um and so uh the malaria parasites form
42:10
these collectives within rotating vort uh vortices And so uh these spor sporzoites are
42:18
injected by a mosquito into the skin and they form these uh vortices in which
42:24
they reside. And so that's the kind of collective behavior he's describing here. Uh where he's doing agent-based
42:30
modeling or the group is doing agent-based modeling to figure out kind of what the propulsion dynamics are and
42:39
what the physical uh attributes of that are in terms of elastic energy and how
42:46
that can be extent to understanding elastic matter.
42:52
This is another paper related to this. The power of parasite collectives. Uh plasmodiums or zoites can move in
43:00
rotating vortices only to their chyal shape and mechanical flexibility revealing important physical aspects of
43:06
collective motion. So we can see that these uh ores serve as sort of these
43:12
organizing uh structures. If you look at fish, they often form vortices as sort
43:18
of these collective behive behavioral structures
43:23
uh and they're very similar to these vortexes of sporzoites. These vortices are self- sorting which
43:30
means that you know there's sorting that happens within the uh within the vortex
43:35
based on speed and curvature. And then these vortices don't just hap they don't
43:42
just pop up. They're self-organized but their self-organization are based in a
43:47
number of key ingredients. So first you need chyro movement which is movement along a curve and kind of translates
43:54
into this uh this circular motion. So you need this sort of chyro orientation.
44:01
In this case it's kind of move bending uh to the to the left I guess. So it
44:07
might be considered left-handed. And then you have these steric interactions where you have movement of these chairo
44:14
uh vectors and kind of moving them close to one another or apart from one another
44:19
and finding the optimal distance between one another. So you can see that these
44:24
chyro movements actually each of the u
44:30
each of the parasites have their own chyro movement in this vortex and then
44:35
these these uh chyro movements are separated by a certain distance.
44:41
Sometimes they're nearly overlapping other times have a little bit more distance but they try to maintain sort
44:47
of a healthy distance without being too far apart. And then finally mechanical
44:53
flexibility. So sometimes these vortices can maintain their integrity while under
44:58
conditions of turbulence. So you get this bending of the paral movements of this of the of the form and you end up
45:06
with a stable vortex. So they kind of described all of this
45:12
and the mechanical flexibility here. Um and that's just another paper kind of
45:17
highlighting this. Uh so this is another social media
45:22
post by Or Schwarz. A bridge between experiments and models is quantitative image processing. This revealed that
45:29
orzoes and the vortices are sorted according to speed and curvature at the vortices undergo shape oscillations.
45:36
So again there's this adaptive feature. So this is all
45:41
from the May 30th meeting in 2022. Um, and so it's, you know, it's
45:47
interesting to kind of revisit that. Um, but I wanted to go back to some of that
45:54
work. Um, this is a p new paper that the group has put out. Um, this is
46:00
three-dimensional chyroactive Orstein Oenbeck model for helical motion of
46:05
microorganisms. So this is uh the a brand new paper.
46:11
It's on the archive and it describes active movement being essential for the
46:17
survival of microorganisms like bacteria, algae, and unicellular parasites. In three dimensions, well,
46:25
swimming and gliding microorganisms often exhibit helical trajectories. So,
46:30
this is where you have uh microorganisms that move around their environment, their liquid environment, and they
46:37
exhibit these helical trajectories. Often times you'll see uh like they might have a rotor on on the on their
46:44
fleellum or they might just move helically which means they move in these
46:49
circular motions outward. So they're moving in this helix. They produce this helix as a sort of a trace of where
46:56
they've been. One such case are malaria parasites gliding through 3D hiker gels for which
47:03
we find that the internal correlation time for the stochastic process generating propulsion is similar to the
47:10
time taken for one helical turn. So this is where you know there's this uh
47:16
stochastic process that produces the propulsion you get this helical turn and
47:21
there's this correlation between them motivated by this experimental finding here we theoretically analyze the case
47:28
of finite internal correlation times from microorganisms with helical trajectories as chyroactive particles
47:36
with an orenstein oolenbeck process for torque. So describing the torque component of those um of those
47:44
movements, we present an analytical solution which is in very good agreement with computer simulations. We then show
47:51
that for this type of internal noise, corality and rotation increase the persistence of motion results in helical
47:59
trajectories that have a larger long time mean square displacement than straight trajectories. This is at the
48:05
same propulsion speed. Finally, we provide experimental evidence for this prediction for the case of the maria
48:11
parasites. So, this kind of talks about this is from the stuff that I talked about from
48:18
2022 and kind of applying it forward to this paper today. Um,
48:25
and so, uh, however, most of these studies consider 2D cases whereas
48:30
helical motion of chyroactive particles occurs in 3D. So they're extending this to that third dimension of the 3D case.
48:38
If chyro active motion in 3D was analyzed theoretically but mostly in the context of swimming. Uh and early work
48:46
on asymmetric swimmers in 3D considered the analogy to polymer models to extract
48:51
new power laws for effective diffusion. In general the statistics of fluctuating
48:57
helyses is also an important aspect of helical biopolymers like DNA.
49:03
Previous work on sperm swimming considered stoasticity on the level of curvature and torsion and showed that
49:10
helical trajectories are useful search strategies for chemotaxis in noisy
49:15
environments. So this is all to say that you know this isn't just studying some
49:22
you know random phenomena. This has implications for chemotaxis or
49:28
chemotactic following for motility uh you know and then of course how
49:36
microorganisms interact with their liquid environment. So this is kind of
49:41
getting at a lot of these different issues all at once. This line of work also considered colored noise in the
49:48
form of a power spectrum. One study of chyro motion 3D started from the full
49:53
mobility tensor for an arbitrarily shaped particle which show the helical
49:58
trajectories are the most likely outcome. Similarly, a chyroactive brownian particle model has been used to
50:05
describe the helical motion of uh lenoflagulates and to show that purely
50:11
stochastic propulsion can result in effective disparity. More very recently has been shown in a
50:17
deterministic model for sperm swimming that an asymmetric beat of the fleellum
50:22
tends to hel that leads to helical trajectories with high persistence.
50:28
Collectively this body of work demonstrates that helical trajectories can have evolutionary advantages for
50:34
micro. So this has to do with noise and how this uh kind of
50:42
uh relates to sort of how noise is used in motility. How noise is produced by
50:48
biological systems and sometimes noise is a good thing as well as a bad thing.
50:53
One of the sessions at the aife conference talked about noise and biology and you know noise we often
51:00
think of noises as is illitarious or bad but sometimes noise can drive
51:06
different processes and augment them and improve them in different ways. Sometimes we fight noise and and in
51:13
fighting noise we actually have these sort of adaptive evolutionary traits
51:18
that that uh arise. So we can do things to buffer the color noise.
51:24
And so this is um how they're modeling this. The uh look at an Orstein Oland
51:32
process and this usually replaces the body fixed constant velocity with a
51:37
noisy velocity performing an U process around a body fixed average. So they're
51:43
modeling this these movements with noise and they're able to sort of understand
51:48
these things in breeds. Um and so this is kind of showing these
51:54
reconstructor trajectories of the malaria parasites producing these uh chyro motions
52:01
outward. So these these spiral vectors and this is where they're
52:07
gliding through a synthetic hydrogel. Um because this environment is nearly
52:13
isotropic meaning there's very little uh heterogeneity in the environment the
52:18
right-handed helical trajectories persist for a long time. So you can see that they can produce these very long
52:25
trajectories that persist that they'll have to to you know shift their motion
52:31
in any one direction. They can produce these very clear signatures of this
52:37
spiral movement.
52:46
Okay, so that was that paper. Um,
52:51
another and I wanted to get to this because our group was interested in this topic. But Or Schwarz in his lab,
52:58
they've also produced some work on cential embryos. And so this is uh from
53:03
the journal of theoretical biology. Um this is from 2014 and this paper is a
53:09
computational model of nuclear self-organization and cential embryos.
53:15
Um so this is where they present an individualbased simulation of the
53:20
drosophyl melanagaster embryo focusing on dynamic changes in intra nuclear
53:26
forces throughout the cell cycle. Repulsive forces are necessary and sufficient to affect correct nuclear
53:33
self-organization. Cytokeleletal networks must be performed quickly after mitosis and disordering is
53:40
nonlinearly correlated with. So if you remember we talked about
53:45
cential structures coming from cells that fuse together and the cells as the
53:53
cells fuse together the nuclei can divide. So you can have nuclear
53:59
division. So you can have two cells that merge together that new cell will have two nuclei and
54:07
then those nuclei can divide. So your cential structure can consist of two cells would have many more nucle.
54:15
And so all these things uh require different types of internal forces in
54:22
the cell. You need to have modified SK cytokeleletal networks as uh cells fuse
54:31
together and you get different structures within the cell. And you know
54:37
so you go through this nucle the set of nuclear divisions and set of cell divisions. And so this is an interesting
54:43
system because we generally think of uh cell divisions as including the nucleus
54:48
and the cytoplasm and everything that kind of segregate out and divide. And
54:53
that's not what we see with cential structures. We see sort of the opposite or we see uh very complex nuclear
55:02
dynamics. So this is um let's go through the abstract. Uh cential embryos developed
55:10
through cycles of nuclear division and rearrangement within a common cytoplasm.
55:15
A paradigmatic example is the Drosophila melanagaster in which nuclei form from
55:20
an ordered array in the embryo surface over cell cycles 10 through 13. So Drosophila melanagaster is a famous
55:27
example of how you can have these cential structures at a very large large
55:33
scale and so this is uh the example they give. This ordering process is assumed
55:41
to be essential for subsequent cellularization. So you have the cential structure that breaks down into
55:47
different cells. So in this case you get this cential structure that builds up. You get a single cell that has a number
55:55
a large number of nuclei and then each of those nuclei then eventually you get
56:00
these different cells that cellularize and then you proceed with development.
56:05
So you know we have these different dynamics. We have cell fusion, we have
56:11
nuclear division, then we have cell not cell division necessarily but cell
56:16
differentiation um and what they call cellularization. So that's what they have here. Um
56:25
using quantitative tissue analysis it has been previously shown that the regrowth of actin and microtubial
56:32
networks after nuclear division generates reordering forces that counteract its disordering effect. We
56:40
present here an individual-based computer simulation modeling the nuclear dynamics. In contrast to similar
56:47
modeling approaches such as epithelial monollayers or tumor spheroids, we focus
56:52
not on the spatial dependence but rather on the time dependence of the interactions.
56:58
We show that appropriate phenomenological interuclear force laws reproduce experimentally observed
57:05
dynamics provided that the cytokeleletal network regrows sufficiently quickly
57:10
after mitosis. So you have u you know all these different things going on.
57:18
Then repulsive forces provided by the acting system are necessary and sufficient to regain the observed level
57:24
of order in the system after the strong disruption resulting from the cytokeleletal network disassembly and
57:31
spindle formation. So you still have spindle formation and you have changes in the cytokeleletal network that need
57:38
to be you know there's they need to be overcome. So this is
57:45
you know these are all things that we can model. We also observe little mixing of nuclei through cell cycles. Our study
57:52
highlights the importance of the dynamics of cytokeleletal forces during this critical phase of cential
57:58
development and emphasizes the need for real-time experimental data at high
58:04
temporal resolution. So this is just showing the system in in
58:10
Drosophila where they have these different nuclei. You have this motic wave as you would have with individual
58:17
cells and you get these nuclei that undergo mitosis. They divide and then
58:22
they form these cells that are lined up. Then in cellularization each of these
58:27
nuclei have a cell that forms around it. So this is where they kind of show the
58:34
dynamics here of nuclear division. You have this mitoic wave. You have nuclear
58:42
division. You have interphase and then mitosis which show the spindle formation and
58:48
spindle dynamics. And so there are these interphase force laws which we can use to describe
58:55
interphase as a step in nuclear division. This is their simulation where
59:00
they show uh the cential embryo. Starting from interphase, the embryo
59:06
under goes a period of mitosis with nuclear division being initiated at the poles of the embryo. So these areas up
59:14
here and down here. Subsequent to mitosis, daughter nuclei are driven apart by the motic spindle. So you have
59:22
these uh the poles are in red. The sort of the midsection is in blue
59:29
and then uh we have nuclei been driven apart by the motic spindle. So you see
59:35
here uh and then before reordering is C and then D is nuclear color indicates cell
59:42
age. So this shows that.
59:54
Okay, that was a good paper. Um, so yeah, and then finally I wanted to highlight
1:00:00
Schwarz. He's at H Highleberg University in Germany and he has a number of publications here uh that you might want
1:00:08
to look into. He's done a lot of things in bioysics. Really interesting modeling
1:00:14
and physics looking at theoretical soft matter and biological physics. All
1:00:20
right, so that's all for today. Thanks for watching and see you next
