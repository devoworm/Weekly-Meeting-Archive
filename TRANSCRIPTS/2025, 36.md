## TRANSCRIPT
0:00   
Hello. How are you? Yeah, fine. Great.   
0:07   
That's good. I haven't done much. So, I don't know. Did you have any   
0:13   
papers you wanted me to go over or the last time it was pretty good? I um I think I might have got one, but   
0:21   
it wasn't I think you mostly went over them last week. The ones like I have a   
0:26   
whole binder here. Um, and I have to make notes and then write about them. I and make sure that   
0:34   
I've got all of the relevant ones. Yeah. Uh, so that I can be thorough and then I   
0:40   
can add it with what I wrote already and I might have a paper.   
0:45   
Yeah. So, I've I've I'm almost there in a way.   
0:51   
Yeah. I have my references. I have my new references. And then I have uh written   
0:57   
half of it. which is just a summary of my thesis but right   
1:03   
yeah very brief one I'm not explaining how tense segrity   
1:09   
works or anything in it just sort of an overview of how it works   
1:15   
but it would be nice if there was some software out there that would do tensity because like the entire human body from   
1:23   
macroscopic to microscopic is our 10seg integities. They're well intention. So,   
1:33   
some sides get compressed and but basically they're hanging like   
1:41   
hanging on to each other, attached to each other. So,   
1:47   
yeah. How come you had so many last week and this week there doesn't seem to be many?   
1:53   
I mean, people or Yeah. Oh, I don't know. Well, I think uh   
1:59   
uh Leith wanted to present on on his work and he had his friend here. So, I   
2:06   
mean, I don't know. Uh yeah, it was nice. Yeah.   
2:12   
I don't know. Well, anyways, I have some things planned here. I wanted to go over actually a nice paper on something   
2:20   
called the cellular Olympics and then yeah, we'll see what that is.   
2:25   
And then uh another paper on these structures that are co like self-organized by insects. We'll see   
2:34   
what that looks like. Okay. Yeah. I have these two papers. Uh let's   
2:39   
go over it. Yeah. This is the cellular Olympics. This is from annual reviews of   
2:44   
microbiology and the subtitles ultra fast cellular motility across the tree of life. So   
2:51   
this is Ray Chang and Mano Perash. Manu Pesh has done a lot of interesting things with different uh with in in   
2:59   
cellular biology in general. So I wonder if you've done any Ken   
3:04   
segregation. Yeah, I haven't seen Yeah, might look over as publications but I doubt it. Um   
3:12   
this is on like this is bioysics and actually cellular ultra fast bioysics   
3:19   
um and insiliates and dinoflagulates. It's funny the the development of the   
3:27   
axelottles is ultra slow biopysics. Oh really? Yeah.   
3:32   
Well yeah it it happens over hours like two days.   
3:38   
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you have to really kind of devote   
3:43   
a lot to imaging for that. Like just getting a maybe like a real time account   
3:49   
of it. Okay. I maybe while I'm thinking of it, um I'm going to do this project where   
3:57   
I'm trying to get a baseline on salamander eggs blastil development   
4:04   
using optical coherence tomography. Um,   
4:09   
I guess I should ask Dick this too. Like, how often should I image them? If I imaged only 20   
4:18   
eggs, would that be enough? Um, I guess that's sort of a statistical   
4:24   
question in a way. Yeah. Um, maybe I I'll ask Dick, but yeah, I   
4:31   
need to I need to figure that out. Yeah.   
4:41   
Okay. So yeah, um so let's go over the abstract. Uh so surprisingly many single   
4:50   
cell organisms and specialized cell types can achieve speed and acceleration significantly faster than those of   
4:57   
multisellular animals. They're dealing with single cell organisms with siliates   
5:02   
and dinoflagulates. And this is of course different than migration in a   
5:07   
multisellular embryo where you have you know migration during different stages like   
5:13   
gastrolation cells are moving around and they're change the embryo itself is   
5:18   
changing its shape. Uh but this is you know single cells so they're moving around their environment. Uh they might   
5:26   
be moving around collectively but it's always faster than in the embryo.   
5:32   
Um these remarkable cellular machines must integrate energy storage and amplification and actuation   
5:40   
latches for trigger release and energy dissipation without failure. So you have   
5:46   
these um you know aspects of actuation and latching and and other types of   
5:53   
things and they have to develop these very reliable mechanisms. And so   
6:00   
basically have these macroolelecular assemblies inside the cell that build these structures.   
6:06   
In this review we first map the atlas of single cells across the tree of life use   
6:11   
ultraast motility. So this is um they're proposing I guess that there's some clay   
6:18   
where ultra fast motility has evolved and has these kind of mechanisms or   
6:24   
ultra fast motility very high high performance high accuracy mechanisms.   
6:32   
We then quantitatively compare extreme acceleration speed area strain rate   
6:37   
volume expansion strain rate and density change rate among single cells. So we   
6:43   
have these different measures. We have extreme acceleration which is just acceleration but we have to have a a   
6:50   
technology that can capture the speed of you know the uh movement without   
6:55   
aliasing. We have speed which is of course you know measuring the um displacement   
7:04   
as opposed to acceleration which is a derivative of of pos like the second   
7:09   
derivative of position instead of the first area strain rate which is of course   
7:15   
something that Susan is interested in where I guess you measure it over an area   
7:21   
uh volume expansion strain rate uh where again this is just kind of like the difference between just area and then   
7:30   
volume expansion or sort of expanding that area   
7:35   
and then density change rate which is you know changes in density I   
7:41   
guess and this is all among single cells. So you need these different types of measurements and you need to be able   
7:48   
to drive them from microscopy. Next we generalize these ideas by   
7:54   
placing various trigger actuation and dissipation mechanisms   
8:00   
within a unified framework. So we have these different mechanisms. Trigger,   
8:05   
actuation and dissipation. So trigger would be like I guess something that   
8:11   
kicks it off. Actuation is something that helps it move and dissipation is   
8:17   
where you have like a release into the environment.   
8:24   
We conclude that with a detailed summary of the diverse functions enabled by ultra fast cellular motility   
8:31   
providing a comprehensive foundation for understanding extreme bioysics and its   
8:37   
diverse role to cellular scale. So this is again this extreme bioysics that   
8:42   
requires specific metrics. It also requires you know a good uh type of   
8:49   
microscopy the appropriate type of microscopy and then it requires these kind of   
8:56   
mechanisms and thinking about them in a in a theoretical framework.   
9:03   
Okay. So like a lot of these uh annual review articles they have like a table of contents.   
9:09   
So it looks like you know we can go through this. It looks like they classify behavioral phenotypes for ultra   
9:16   
fast motility. So they have hydrodnamic swimmers,   
9:22   
hydrodnamic jumpers, elastic jumpers,   
9:27   
surface base motility. That's where they sort of you have these swimmers kind of on the surface versus   
9:35   
swimmers within the water column. So hydrodnamic being you know I guess uh   
9:42   
optimized for going through the water column fast elastic jumpers uh that   
9:49   
could be just on the surface of the water where they jump from place to   
9:55   
place or they jump in a certain way and there's an elasticity involved in that.   
10:00   
Then there's of course surface based motility where they move around the surface. There is contraction without   
10:07   
transllocation. There's cell protrusions of extra sums   
10:12   
and extreme volume and density changes. So all these things are involved in ultraast motility.   
10:19   
And then quantitative comparison for ultraast cellular motility. We have ultraast velocity and ultraast   
10:26   
acceleration. So these are two components of position. So we can get   
10:31   
this information from positional data over time. If we sample the trajectory   
10:37   
dense enough, we can get velocity and acceleration, but we need to be able to get that information at a high enough   
10:44   
scale or a fine enough scale for it to be like accurate.   
10:51   
Um then they have trigger mechanisms of cellular ultraast motility actuation   
10:56   
mechanisms and energy storage of cellular ultra ultra fast motility. So these are trigger and actuation   
11:03   
mechanisms. Um so one the trigger mechanism is for cellular ultraast motility and actuation   
11:11   
mechanisms are and energy storage are also for cellular ultra fast motility.   
11:17   
uh so this is a lot of u sort of uh bioysics internal bioysics so this is   
11:26   
calcium sensitive ATP independent non-actin filaments cataclysmic microtubial disassembly so   
11:34   
this is where you have changes in the uh I guess changes in the structure of the   
11:39   
cytokeleton with respect to movement uh the condensation of secret proteins,   
11:48   
osmotic pressurdriven mechanisms, and purely hydrodnamic based mechanisms.   
11:54   
So, I mean, this this one looks really interesting, 5.2. Uh, then 5.3 also looks interesting.   
12:01   
It's just basically a lot of sort of adaptations that the cell needs to make to do this kind of ultra fast movement.   
12:10   
Then there's energy dissipation mechanisms of cellular ultra fast motility   
12:15   
functions. were general functions of solar ultra fast motility and then some discussion about it. So I   
12:23   
I actually wrote a couple of blog posts about this like years ago and just kind of of thinking about like different sort   
12:31   
of movements that you see in multisellular organisms thinking across the plate of vertebrates and   
12:37   
invertebrates. Anyways, uh this kind of talks about   
12:42   
how you see movements in across the tree of life. So, um   
12:51   
it kind of talks about like really fast movements or really fast organisms and   
12:57   
really slow or you know so actually he talks about very fast movements in   
13:03   
animals and in plants. So um this is for example the cheetah is the fastest   
13:09   
running land animal with a horizontal speed of up to 25 meters per second and   
13:14   
an acceleration of 1.5 gravity. A grasshopper jump can reach an acceleration of 18 gravity. Um plants   
13:22   
have an evolve also evolved various ultraast mechanisms for nutrient acquisition and reproduction   
13:29   
exhibiting velocities and accelerations comparable to those of animals. And we   
13:34   
don't think of plants as being big movers. I mean, they obviously move like their cells move out and extrude as   
13:41   
they're growing their leaves and they're growing their roots, but we don't think of that as being particularly fast. And   
13:49   
actually, as it turns out, there are very fast movements in plants,   
13:54   
especially with respect to nutrient acquisition and reproduction.   
13:59   
So this is um some specialized mechanisms again like what you see with   
14:04   
the cheetah and with grasshoppers in terms of uh like move moving uh like   
14:10   
limb muscles and limb composition. You see this in plants as well. So in plants   
14:18   
you have the bladder worm bladder wart suction trap which can achieve a fluid velocity of 1.5 m/s   
14:25   
and an acceleration of 600g allowing the plant to trap water fleas and worms for its food. The bunchberry   
14:33   
flower has a catapult mechanism enabling it to eject pollen at a velocity of 7.5   
14:39   
meters/s and an acceleration of 2,400 gs. as its   
14:45   
pollination is self incompatible and requires a sultterest mechanism to enhance insect pollination and   
14:53   
potentially wind pollination. On an even faster scale, the famous   
14:58   
mantis shrimp appendage can strike at 31 meters/s and 25,000g.   
15:05   
So when we say gra like a gravity you know if you think about like um   
15:12   
pilots when they fly a plane and they fly it at 1g or 2g you know this is this   
15:18   
is like uh that that's sort of the me uh measure here   
15:24   
um that's uh a lot because people can only withstand about 10 gi   
15:32   
Yeah yeah it's a lot and it's interesting Because you know, you think that if we were exposed to those kind of   
15:37   
inertial forces, you know, it would tear your your body apart. But these are   
15:43   
adaptations where you can evolve biological materials or biological structures, functional structures that   
15:50   
exert many many more gs of force than we would have.   
15:55   
Yeah. I I've always been opposed to centrifuging things u like eggs and   
16:02   
sperm because I think it kills them. Yeah. Yeah. Well,   
16:07   
there was an experiment done. I was asked to review the article and they   
16:13   
actually centrifuged sperm and they found that the longer you did it, the   
16:20   
less success rate there was in fertilizing eggs. Yeah. So I said, "Oh, somebody actually   
16:27   
did a practical experiment that that um works that explains why some things in a   
16:36   
laboratory don't don't work. Put it through the centrifuge."   
16:43   
I just Yeah. So I praise the article very highly and sent it on its way.   
16:51   
Yeah. I think the rule sometimes is like you can centrifuge RNA and proteins all you   
16:58   
want but like cells if you put cells in a in a tube you have to be very careful because they can't withstand that kind   
17:05   
of those kind of centrifugal forces they'll they'll break apart and so   
17:10   
that's sperm are sort of alive like they've got   
17:15   
ATP going on and structure and yeah you can wreck that yeah which I It was just Yeah.   
17:23   
Yeah. Which begs the question, why did these cells and these types of structures survive these kind of forces?   
17:29   
I imagine you could um work on some engineering if you could   
17:36   
understand the whole mechanism there. I think it I think that would be great like you could design your micro machine   
17:44   
to propel something if you Yeah. study those mechanisms.   
17:49   
Yeah. and the protections around those mechanisms so you won't wreck the wreck   
17:56   
the machine. Yeah. Yeah. That this is a very good   
18:04   
and interesting thing. It leads to other other other things.   
18:09   
Right. Right. Yeah, it does. So, look at the papers and find the the   
18:17   
flower and study them. Yeah. Well, now there's some other organisms.   
18:23   
So, like a lot of times you'll have organisms where they have a specific function that where they have like a   
18:29   
ballistic movement that is very fast. And you know, you can think of like a frog's tongue that goes out and gets   
18:35   
like an insect. It shoots it out and brings it back in. It's very fast. And   
18:40   
that's a lot of force that's being generated. And then, you know, the it isn't just kind of like put out at the   
18:47   
onset. there's a control there that you know the tongue doesn't just shoot out and fly all over the place. It it kind   
18:54   
of comes out and comes back in. And uh in this case that they give here, the   
19:00   
famous mantis shrimp appendage can strike at 31 meters per second in 25,000g.   
19:06   
So that you know appendage of course is being sent out, but it's also being controlled uh by the the organism and   
19:14   
then the anatomy is still intact as it's making that movement. Um it's worth saying that there is like   
19:20   
we do have a lot of faster movements like uh you know our our whole body if   
19:26   
we were to sort of subject it to these high G forces would be ripped apart but   
19:32   
we have things like if we throw a baseball or something you know your arm moves especially the fingers you know   
19:40   
they experience a lot more geforces in doing that locally so it's not that you   
19:45   
know we can't survive it it's that it depends on you know there's a whole biomechanics of sort of a kinematic   
19:52   
chain that happens uh that that is sort of set up by the movement. So you're   
19:58   
generating forces from the sort of the middle of the body outward and then   
20:03   
those forces are sort of being amplified as they go outward. And so you know it's   
20:08   
but it's still it's the question is what is the geometry of the structure that's being subjected to these geforces   
20:16   
you know is it uh just kind of uh generic   
20:22   
configuration or is it something more um you know specialized. So trap giants   
20:29   
construct their mandible at 64 meters per second and 100,000 gs.   
20:34   
Uh so those are two examples from the multisellular world.   
20:40   
Um five million G's. What's that? Overy.   
20:46   
Yeah. So this is uh so okay actually these examples from the multisellular   
20:52   
world though impressive require specialized tissues and or exoskeletons   
20:57   
to achieve these ultra fast movements. However, none surpasses the 5.4 4   
21:02   
million G acceleration of the pneumaticis discharge in hydra which is   
21:07   
ultimately a single cell phenomena performed by specialized uh cells called   
21:13   
pneumatices. So this is pneumatic discharge. Yeah. Uh   
21:18   
I think it's um you know it's just a I don't know. Yeah. I don't know what   
21:24   
what that is but um like I don't know the process behind it.   
21:30   
Despite our fascination with the many macroscopic examples, the extremes in the cellular world remain largely   
21:37   
unexplored. And then that's where they come in with their ultraast sort of uh phenomena   
21:44   
characterization. So um they actually kind of talk about hydra here. Um so ultra fast phenomena   
21:53   
pose unique challenges for single cells is they must store all required energy within their small size and deploy it   
22:00   
precisely like I was talking about with um you know different appendages moving   
22:06   
towards a target. For hydronmatices, the task is somewhat easier as their   
22:12   
discharge is a singleshot non-reversible event. So, it's just shooting things out into the environment. And these   
22:18   
specialized cells are supported by surrounding tissues. So, these are, you know, it's not like they're just being   
22:24   
sent out and and have to experience those geforces all on their own. There are surrounding tissues that that   
22:30   
support that. However, single cell organisms with ultra fast motility lack   
22:36   
this luxury as they must also perform all the necessary functions as a single unit. In addition, single cells must   
22:43   
ensure their own survival and functionality after deploying an ultraast mechanism as extreme velocity   
22:50   
and acceleration usually indicate the presence of extreme shear and bulk forces. So this is where you know you   
22:57   
experience these different types of extreme uh forces   
23:02   
uh during this process. So this is something again that you have to in the   
23:08   
ca in some cases you have a tissue surrounding the cells that protect the cells but in this case it's just the   
23:14   
cell itself and so you you want to have a way to protect the interior of the   
23:21   
cell and some of the mechanisms within the cell. So these constraints impose additional   
23:27   
evolutionary pressures on organisms capable of ultra fast motility. So in this review we present we first   
23:34   
present a quantitative map of single cell organisms demonstrate ultraast motility including locomotion   
23:41   
contractility volume expansion and density changes. So these are all the the properties. Um we then classify and   
23:50   
quantitatively compare these behavioral phenotypes in terms of their acceleration, speed,   
23:57   
area strain rate, volume expansion strain rate, density change rate across   
24:02   
the entire tree of life. We report these quantitative numbers either from the   
24:08   
literature or from reanalysis of published data. And we conclude with a comprehensive review of the trigger   
24:14   
mechanisms as we had mentioned um and and how those kind of correspond to   
24:21   
evolutionary adaptations. This is the atlas. So you have this   
24:26   
atlas and it's just like different ultra fast cells and they have like a legend   
24:31   
here. Um so if we go in a little bit I maybe I can. So they're numbered and you   
24:38   
can see that they're these different uh cells. They're kind of labeled by   
24:45   
sometimes it's genus and species, sometimes it's the genus spa, which is like they can't uh define the species,   
24:52   
but they know what the genus is. And so they're just yeah just these different like I see parramium in here and uh   
25:02   
let's see um   
25:08   
Alaria I mean you know a lot of things that you would see in the in the unicellular   
25:16   
world. So you have things with fella, you have things that are kind of radially organized, you know, things   
25:23   
that look like a tree, you have things that are axally   
25:29   
oriented. Um, and other types of cells.   
25:34   
Uh, yeah. So these are all very interesting structures. Um, definitely not what you might   
25:42   
expect. Um but yeah, so there are all sorts of evolutionary adaptations hidden in here.   
25:49   
So um just to give you an idea what we're talking about. And so this the the   
25:55   
caption says organisms with ultraast cellular motility scaled relative to one   
26:00   
another. Ultraast organisms which come in a wide range of sizes, shapes and behavioral phenotypes are present in   
26:07   
multiple major branches of the ukareotic phoggenetic tree. This list includes organisms of fast   
26:14   
transllocation, contraction, extrusion of organels and   
26:19   
even fast volume and area changes. So these are all things that you know kind of ways in which they uh execute these   
26:27   
movements of transllocation, contraction, extrusion and then fast volume and area changes. So you can   
26:34   
imagine like how you know some of this stuff isn't like uh movements to and   
26:41   
from somewhere some of it is changing its shape in response to the environment but doing so in a very fast manner. So   
26:48   
that's why you know your uh microtubules have to undergo   
26:54   
this sort of uh wide scale you know widespread disassembly and things like that because   
27:01   
it's actually changing the structure of the cell and it's doing it in an ultra fast way.   
27:08   
So um yeah they kind of go over some of these examples.   
27:14   
Um, so there's there one set of uh cells   
27:20   
here. I think they're bacteria that can reach a swimming speed of up to 468 BL   
27:26   
per second and 393 BL per second respectively. They are thermophilic   
27:31   
hydro uh hydrogenotrophic methanogens. So they're   
27:37   
bacteria preferring high temperatures near hydrothermal vents and they live on oxygen or hydrogen and carbon dioxide   
27:45   
producing methane as a byproduct. Their swimming patterns are characterized by fast straight swimming and relocate to   
27:52   
slower zigzag swimming near a surface. So these are these kind of extreophiles   
27:58   
that um you know have to do things they have already have a lot of properties of   
28:05   
kind of extreme adaptations to a a hydrothermal environment   
28:11   
and you know hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean where you have you're you're not only subjected to   
28:17   
great pressures from the deep sea but you also have to survive in these kind   
28:23   
of really hot environments we're synthesizing hydrogen and carbon dioxide   
28:28   
and producing methane. So, uh this is sort of also they're exhibiting these   
28:35   
very fast movements. So, this is uh kind of all part of the set of extreme   
28:41   
adaptations. Another example of a fast bacterium is this species here. uh a predatory   
28:49   
bacterium with a single flegellum capable of penetrating and replicating within bacterial prey.   
28:56   
Restrain HD 100. This one micron bacterium can swim up to 160 microns per   
29:03   
second. This of course is 160 times their size. Early hypothesis suggested   
29:10   
that the species used uses its fast motility to drill and penetrate the prey   
29:16   
cell. But later genetic knockout study showed that fleeller motility is not   
29:21   
essential for prey entry and thus plays a role only in efficient prey encounters. So that's an interesting   
29:28   
mode of like survival is being uh you're   
29:34   
uh predating another bacterium but you're much smaller than them but you can actually move much faster than them   
29:39   
as well. And a lot of that fast movement is to sort of encounter your prey. And   
29:46   
you know this is in their fleeller. So they're moving their fleellum to get the make the movement. So it's a whole whole   
29:53   
structure there of macroolelecules that are involved in this.   
30:02   
You were gonna say something. No, I just think it's interesting. Yeah. Yeah.   
30:09   
I don't know if I'd want either one of them inside me. Yeah, probably not.   
30:14   
Just no.   
30:20   
These are hydrodnamic jumpers. So, we classify organisms of swimming   
30:25   
trajectories characterized by slower regulating swimming modes interspersed with sudden high-speed jumps is   
30:32   
hydrodnamic jumpers. So, these are like two modes of motion. where you have   
30:37   
swimming which is slower and then these high-speed jumps. So it's like that you know whatever they they might be   
30:45   
encountering some prey or something or they may need to move away from something uh that is you know maybe   
30:52   
they're the prey and that's the these jumps within the water.   
30:57   
So many small ciliates have evolved the ability to perform sudden jumps and they are collectively referred to as jumping   
31:03   
ciliates. Uh they include halteria uh mezodinium,   
31:10   
escensia, cyclladium, clerona, sturbalidium,   
31:17   
uh eurotrica, uh euronichia and diaphorus as well as   
31:22   
weaker jumpers like stidium and stylia.   
31:29   
So if we take culturia grenadelia as an example, this 20 micron liatrop liatro   
31:36   
liatri normally swims forward at 0.2 to 0.3 millimeters per second and that's 10   
31:43   
to 15 bl per second. Um I'm not sure what the BL measurement is, but that's   
31:49   
what it's corresponds to. Um but when disturbed by flow or a high concentration of potassium chloride it   
31:57   
performs a powerful backward jump at 3.2 millimeters/ second or 160 BL per   
32:03   
second. The maximum normalized speed of jumping ciliates typically falls between   
32:08   
50 and 200 bl per second with the st uh strobalidium species having the fastest   
32:16   
recorded speed of 20 2.76 cm per second or 361 BL per second for a 76 micron   
32:24   
cell. These fast jumps are enabled by exceptionally high increases in the psyia beating frequency from 105 to 260   
32:33   
hertz. So this is of course the silia is driving this. It's beating really fast   
32:39   
and it's it's enabling these kind of fast movements. And of course you need   
32:44   
to have a specialized psyia for that. You can't just have the standard psyia. So that's a set of evolutionary   
32:51   
adaptations there. Many dinoflaguloates also exhibit hydrodnamic jumps. Examples   
32:57   
include uh and sinella rafaria.   
33:04   
Uh okay. So these are the there I'm not going to bother with it. There there are   
33:09   
a number of different species that do this. Um and uh a grandera also holds   
33:17   
the record for absolute speed swimming at 1 1,603 microns per second while uh y   
33:25   
unisunus leads a normalized speed at 1,572 microns per second. So you know these   
33:33   
are just kind of really fast speeds for swimming. Functionally, while these jumps have an obvious role predator   
33:39   
escape, organisms can also use them for ambush attacks or to escape their own nutrient depleted boundary layers to   
33:46   
enhance nutrient diffusion. That's interesting. So, there is this actual aspect of uh feeding that where you just   
33:54   
need to get out of your current area and go somewhere else. Um or you need to   
34:01   
disperse the nutrients that exist in the water column.   
34:06   
So that's that's interesting. Their fast swimming speed is also thought to help in reaching deep water nutrients. So   
34:13   
this is just you know a way to to sort of escape predation but also to get   
34:19   
nutrients. In addition to jumping siliates and dinoflagulates, sudden jumps have been   
34:25   
reported in bolto botottans free living ketlastid   
34:32   
in result of monus moppy primitive green algae. However, no   
34:38   
swimming or jumping speeds have been reported for these species. Uh well although different species are capable   
34:45   
of jumping their jumps are mediated by the ejection of ejecttoomes and this are characterized as cell   
34:51   
protrusions or extrasomes. So I've heard of this before where cells will like   
34:57   
explode or explode part of their body to move. Like there's different explosive   
35:03   
movements that you can observe where they eject a bunch of stuff into the environment and then they move and that   
35:10   
helps them move fast. like it's an explosion. The explosion is very fast and sudden. It moves them at a very high   
35:17   
speed. And this is of course they call an ejecttoone which is you know just saying that   
35:23   
there's ejecta and it's probably some set of biochemicals that gets ejected.   
35:29   
Um and so that's interesting that they they bring that up. They're also elastic jumpers and surface   
35:36   
based motility. uh contraction without transllocation.   
35:41   
So this is uh so surface base motility is where   
35:47   
motility depends on a solid substrate and this includes datoms   
35:52   
and they have the surfacebased motility. So datoms generally lacilia or fleella   
35:59   
can glide on surfaces by using an ectomyiosin system linked into a   
36:04   
secreted adhesive polysaccharide. So this is, you know, we've seen this in meetings before where they secrete these   
36:11   
sort of polysaccharides and other types of bio uh molecules that help them move   
36:17   
in their environ. Elastic jumpers um can contract or   
36:24   
recoil their long appendages instead of using siliary or fleeller beating. So   
36:30   
this these are um different types of ciliates uh that can do this while their when   
36:36   
their appendages contract the cell bodies of uh pseudotonadia and tonatonia   
36:42   
can achieve backward jumps of 653 and 1,470   
36:49   
bl per second respectively. So that's uh kind of there and then uh   
36:56   
electron mic microscopy studies show that its tail consists of numerous nearly parallel membranous tubes and   
37:04   
septa connecting to small bundles of microfilaments where the tupular layers   
37:09   
are separated by aoplasm containing many mitochondria. So of course you need to   
37:15   
have an energy source for this. Um a similar mechanism exists in   
37:20   
haptapytes. Uh when the microtubial in the hptane which is an appendage presented only in   
37:27   
haptapy switches its confirmation the haptinema quails back and causes a   
37:33   
rapid jump of the cell body at six millimeters per second. Another ciliate   
37:40   
u uh zunanthium uh collagium uh although   
37:45   
it does not have a contractile tail can contract the entire pseudo colony and   
37:50   
achieve medusa like locom motion at 110 millimeters per second.   
37:56   
These are that's a lot. Yeah, that's very fast.   
38:02   
Yeah, that's about 250 pseudo colonies per sec. So like the size of the pseudo   
38:07   
colony is you know much smaller and they can move over 250 pseudo colonies away   
38:15   
in in one second. So yeah it's fast and   
38:20   
this is all generated by I I assume your typical um you know set of microtubial   
38:29   
associated proteins and your typical mitochondria. Is is that measin by any   
38:35   
chance? Uh calcium binding calcium binding microtubules like   
38:43   
I don't know. Yeah, maybe it may be another form of that.   
38:50   
Yeah. Well, how is it related to acttomyasin? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. But   
38:59   
I mean you you can see this though that muscles kind of do the similar things, right? Like   
39:05   
Well, so do cell surfaces. Yeah. Yeah. And there the whole idea is that they're they're these structures   
39:12   
that enable movements, sometimes very fast movements, but of course short   
39:17   
periods of time because you have to sustain that movement. And a lot of times it's a burst of energy that it   
39:24   
needs to exert. So it's not like constant. So yeah there are a lot of like if you   
39:31   
think about muscle fibers you know they enable these kind of bursty movements.   
39:36   
You have other mechanisms in um in actin in acttomyosin as well where you can do   
39:43   
that. Yeah it's associated with with calcium.   
39:48   
Yeah. Yeah. It's Is that where it began? The calcium   
39:54   
binding proteins and microtubules that looks like very much like what   
40:01   
happens in cells. Yeah. Yeah.   
40:09   
Yeah. It's a calcium driven process. But yeah, it would be interesting to see. I   
40:14   
don't know if there are any pe any any papers on like thinking about that mechanism more in terms of like how it's   
40:20   
generating this really kind of fast bursts of energy but it'd be interesting   
40:26   
to see. Yeah, because you Yeah, you see it in neurons too like you have action potentials that   
40:32   
are based on calcium ions and things like that. Yes, for sure.   
40:40   
Yeah. So then there's contraction without transllocation. uh we now consider examples of organisms   
40:46   
where contraction of either the entire cell body or its appendages is not used   
40:52   
mainly for transllocation. So this is like we were talking about transllocation where they're moving in   
40:59   
these bursts. Uh but they're actually uh they're contracting   
41:05   
either themselves or their appendages. Either these organisms are attached to a substrate with a stalk where their   
41:11   
motility is symmetric and this results in little net transllocation after a complete actuation relaxation cycle. So   
41:19   
they have these cycles of actuation and relaxation. Um and we saw some examples in the in   
41:26   
figure one where they had like uh these stocks and things connected   
41:32   
together by some stock. So this is uh kind of what they're getting at. And   
41:38   
then you know things contract around that central stock or you know that sort   
41:44   
of thing. Um yeah e so either these organisms are attached to a substrate of   
41:49   
the stock or the motility is symmetric and this results in little net transllocation.   
41:55   
So this is again where you have this symmetric motility as well. So you have   
42:00   
two modes. So examples from ciliates include contractile heterotrixs like uh   
42:06   
sperosonum uh and stent contractile cesaloids like   
42:13   
corticella cartisium and zen zaninium   
42:21   
uh for a review of the biomechanics of very is contractile species C3. So   
42:27   
there's if you you're interested you can go to citation 33 in this paper.   
42:34   
Uh let's take these uh spyro uh tommo and stent as examples. Both are giant   
42:42   
cells single cell ciliates that can grow to millimeter size and contract their cortical myion to reduce their body   
42:49   
length to less than 50% within five milliseconds. So this is like a   
42:54   
reduction of body length. uh just through this contraction process. Um for   
43:02   
speronum uh ambiguum in particular, this rate corresponds to a contraction speed   
43:08   
of 0.2 m/s and an acceleration of 15g.   
43:13   
So this is you know kind of again these fast movements but they're focused now   
43:19   
not on spitting things out into the environment or moving in the environment but contracting their own phenotype.   
43:28   
Fast contraction has also been observed in various heliozonean species. Um for   
43:33   
species uh the for species with outstretched exopodia exapodia they can rapidly   
43:41   
contract when in contact with food organisms. Uh so these are uh these different uh   
43:50   
projections that they have called exapodia. Uh bringing the prey near the body surface.   
43:56   
Uh the contraction speed of exipodia is estimated to be more than 2 millimeters   
44:02   
per second. One special bentham heliozoic species uh   
44:07   
can contract not only its aipodia but also its stock. The stock which is 3 to   
44:12   
400 microns long when fully stretched can be shortened by 90% within 50 to 60   
44:18   
milliseconds resulting in a speed of up to 10 cm/s   
44:23   
and an acceleration of 10g. Okay. So then you have these cell   
44:29   
protrusions and extra sums. So this is another trick in the armory of single   
44:34   
cells is the capacity to extrude parts of the cell or specialized organels.   
44:40   
uh specialized exocyic organels that can extrude materialize at very high speeds   
44:46   
are commonly referred to as extrosomes. So these are um organels that are   
44:53   
shooting materials out. And so this is the extra examples include uh tricosysts   
44:59   
from many ciliates, toxicists uh from many predatory ciliates,   
45:06   
thenoflagulate pneumaticists and then ejecttoomes from cryptomonads   
45:14   
and then uh from all nidarian species and then disco   
45:20   
from uh chryopites. isophites   
45:25   
and then uh so there are all these different mechanisms in different um species and and genus generations.   
45:40   
So they do talk about extreme volume and density changes here. Um   
45:46   
and then they talk about ultra fast acceleration and then they have this figure two. So   
45:53   
this figure two is of course where they have this table of   
46:00   
different uh uh different species and different genre   
46:07   
you know and you can see the different phenotypes. Some of them have uh fleella, some of most of them have   
46:12   
fleella, some of them don't. Um but you can see that they have they're on this   
46:19   
sort of scale which is acceleration in meters/s squared. So you have these um   
46:28   
different um you know so the hydromaticist which we talked about is   
46:33   
really high in terms of acceleration. you have you know organisms that exhibit   
46:40   
lesser acceleration and these are different mechanisms that we described uh earlier. So you can see this sort of   
46:47   
continuum here and then in B you have this not in terms   
46:52   
of acceleration but velocity.   
46:59   
So you have some of the same uh genre here. Um you have hydronneumaticist   
47:07   
firing which has a high velocity as well as a high acceleration. So velocity is   
47:12   
measured in meters/s instead of meters/s squared. Um you have 3T3 cell migration   
47:19   
down here at 10 thegative8 velocity. um neutrfil migration. Uh then EP emp   
47:27   
pingpong motility. You have ecoli swimming. You have datom   
47:32   
jerking motility which we've talked about in um in previous um sessions.   
47:40   
Uh we talked about that as sort of a high high velocity mode in datom   
47:49   
motility. But in in the scheme of things here, it's actually kind of in the middle. So datoms uh aren't necessarily   
47:58   
special in this regard, although they do have these these ultra fast move modes   
48:03   
of movement. You have parramsium tricyus firing. Um   
48:10   
lrimaria or neck extension. Uh you have jumping, you have   
48:17   
contraction. stent contraction, you have   
48:26   
yeah, you have jumping. Yeah. So, you have all these different behavioral modes included in this graph. And then   
48:33   
this is a nice graph. This shows, of course, you might be asking, well, if they exhibit these movements, that's   
48:39   
fine. And, you know, I I would like to see it normalize to organism size   
48:44   
because these are probably a wide range of sizes represented here. So in C we   
48:49   
have cell size in microns versus maximum speed in microns per second. So this   
48:56   
kind of normalizes different movement modes and organisms organism types. This   
49:02   
is ciliates elastic jumpers in purple. Psiliates hydrodnamic jumpers in green.   
49:09   
Ciliates swimmers. Ciliates walkers in blue. Flagillates elastic jumpers.   
49:14   
Flagagulates hydrodnamic jumpers. Glagulate swimmers, procariots in pink,   
49:22   
surface based motility in blue, cell protrusion, extrasome   
49:28   
in I guess like you know wine colored and contraction without transllocation in   
49:35   
purple. So it's kind of they use a lot of very similar colors, but the take-home here   
49:42   
is that ciliate swimmers kind of located in this middle section.   
49:47   
You also have um cell protrusion and extras in the   
49:53   
same region. And some of the outliers include cell protrusion and extras up   
50:00   
here. And you also have um   
50:07   
let's see you have so walkers in the main area and you have the surface base   
50:12   
motility down here. So what are we looking at? Well we see that our outliers are generally in the cell size   
50:19   
of 10 the 1 microns. So you see this maybe a little bit less   
50:25   
a little bit more and then the higher the larger size cells which are greater   
50:30   
than maybe like 10 to the second micro or maybe like you know 100 microns and   
50:38   
larger they kind of follow this trend of maximum speed between 10 to the 5th   
50:45   
microns per second and 10 to the 1st microns per second. So in that they're in that window and so you can see there   
50:52   
is a variety of things within that window as well. um you know as you can see on the chart.   
51:00   
So it's interesting. It's very very um you know it's a lot to unpack and   
51:05   
certainly you know you could make the case that there's a lot of diversity. So even within these categories you have a   
51:12   
lot of different modes of this happening. Um and even depending on if   
51:17   
you normalize it for cell type you see that there's a lot of variation in in   
51:22   
things. If we look at the figure caption comparison of ultraast acceleration and   
51:29   
speed among various single cell organisms. Um most organisms can achieve   
51:35   
maximum velocity of around 10 BL per second. Justifying the definition of a normalized speed greater than 100 BL per   
51:42   
second is ultra fast. So it's the 100 BL per second measure uh threshold. The   
51:51   
cross indicates a dis disco uh which is an inferred number that has   
51:57   
not been experimentally validated. Um and then we have our trigger mechanisms   
52:03   
or actuation mechanisms and our dissipation mechanisms. So our trigger mechanisms can be chemical, mechanical   
52:11   
and chemically gated. So chemical being like these different chemicals uh   
52:17   
chemical effects like pH, digestive enzymes, redux potential, osmolerity,   
52:24   
digestive products and ion concentrations and you might have these gradients in which the cell exists where   
52:32   
they you know react accordingly. You also have these mechanical triggers.   
52:37   
So you have critical membrane tensions, critical strain rates and then me   
52:42   
chemically gated mechanical which is where you might have a prey drive chemical signal signaling a sensory   
52:49   
neuron and then there's a synaptic release of acetylcholine   
52:55   
and then that's so that's kind of talking about the triggers. Activation mechanisms is where you have spas   
53:03   
spasmine uh myion which where you have these contractile heterrores,   
53:10   
contractile cisolates and u echantherans.   
53:17   
Uh you have cataclysmic microtubial disassembly which you see here. You have   
53:22   
a decondensation of secrettory proteins. You have purely hydrodnamic mechanisms   
53:28   
such as jumping ciliates and ultra fast procarots. Then you have osmotic pressure which is shown here. Then your   
53:36   
dissipation mechanisms which is where you have singleshot dissipation.   
53:42   
You see this in the nidarian diaticist where they release things into the environment. You have   
53:48   
compartmentalization and separation from functional cytoplasm which is shown here. You have external hydrodnamic   
53:55   
dissipation. Uh examples include jumping ciliates and ultra fast procarots. And then internal   
54:03   
dissipation where you have this sort of dissipation within the cell in this   
54:11   
species here. So I think that's enough for that paper.   
54:17   
Um a nice lot of nice figures. It's a very hard paper to get through if you uh   
54:23   
don't know much about the biology I guess because you have to go look things up constantly. Um but no I mean you know   
54:31   
the I think the the take-h home lesson here is that you have these different mechanisms for u these ultra fast   
54:38   
movements. They occur under a wide range of conditions in a wide range of species   
54:43   
across the tree of life and and perhaps the mechanis specializations are very   
54:49   
different in different you know even producing the same type of movement in different species and and generate   
54:56   
orders that you find them in. So uh any comments or questions on it?   
55:04   
Okay. Um yeah, she said they should try using structures.   
55:10   
Oh yeah. And studying that. It' be a nice um master's degree.   
55:17   
Yeah. You mean the things that kind of make these things possible or hold the   
55:24   
tissues together as they make these movements? I guess in this case they're just single cells, but they could still   
55:29   
have tensey structures of like Yeah. Yeah. Well, like I said, from   
55:35   
macroscopic, including our our own bodies to microscopic, including   
55:41   
internal cell cellular mechanisms are 10segrity structures where they can be   
55:48   
made into 10segrity structures because they're in tension like they're held   
55:54   
together in tension quite often.   
56:00   
So that that's why it's a tense integrity structure.   
56:06   
Especially if you have microtubules involved. Yeah,   
56:16   
it's a good project. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah. He Manush always   
56:21   
has interesting things to say about different aspects of biohysics. So was   
56:27   
good. I don't know if Morgan had anything he wanted to say here. There he is. He's   
56:36   
home today. I just just got   
56:41   
dropping my   
56:50   
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. So, so I I I'm not sure the context. Um,   
56:58   
but uh I was trying to listen in when I could. Yeah. Okay.   
57:04   
Well, that's Yeah. We were just talking about a paper about different cells and how they make these ultra fast   
57:10   
movements. And they have this cell atlas that they built of all these different cell types that can make these really   
57:16   
fast movements uh like either like through explosive movements or through   
57:22   
sort of collective movements using fleellum and other types of mechanisms.   
57:28   
And so it was really interesting because they kind of cover a lot of like uh   
57:33   
different species in different parts of the tree of life and and seeing kind of how those are generated. And there are   
57:40   
kind of connections, I don't know if you missed it, between like the sort of calcium signaling you see in neurons   
57:47   
that lead to action potentials and then some of the calcium mediated uh signaling that leads to actin   
57:54   
producing some of these movements. Well, yeah. Yeah. You I'm sure you   
58:02   
you've seen this in Michael Leven videos where he he talks about calcium as as   
58:09   
just cellular computation. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Like like he's trying to find a   
58:16   
word which just makes it, you know, generic.   
58:21   
The tri junctions themselves also use that mechanism. Actimosin.   
58:29   
All right. Yeah.   
58:34   
And calcium. You have to have calcium and actin and meosin and ATP and then   
58:40   
you got movement. Yeah. Which, you know,   
58:45   
you can you can imagine that being a a big day in um you know, cellular   
58:51   
evolution. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's interesting that   
58:57   
these um primitive or not primitive, I don't know. Um smaller organisms use use   
59:04   
that as well. That's why I was asking about actin and measin associated   
59:12   
with the calcium and the proteins that they're talking about like what proteins   
59:17   
are those you said proteins. Well, um actin and meosin could be considered   
59:23   
proteins, I guess. Well, so or is it different? That that's a question.   
59:29   
The um I've been trying to get through all the papers, all the 11 papers that are   
59:37   
listed on the um Institute for Computationally Designed   
59:43   
Organisms. Okay. and um and   
59:49   
the I think it's the most recent actually I don't even know if this is the one that's I think this is the one   
59:54   
that's missing maybe it's still like bio archive um   
59:59   
uh but certainly like the 2025 paper super interesting in terms of the um   
1:00:07   
genetic expression right so the the transcript   
1:00:13   
of of the anthro robots is is super super strange and   
1:00:20   
interesting, right? So, it's like remember it's it's um epithelial cells,   
1:00:25   
right? Um that have reself assembled   
1:00:30   
into this glob, but but this glob is using psyia like a   
1:00:38   
like a single-sellled organism to to to move. Yeah. and and um and and have   
1:00:47   
these behaviors that you know are super striking and you know again this is 100%   
1:00:55   
uh human cells you know no gene edits um   
1:01:00   
etc and it's the paper describes the   
1:01:05   
transcriptto as as interesting in that um and I I don't know how they derive   
1:01:12   
this but But um they want to say very very ancient profile.   
1:01:18   
Okay. Um and and I wonder I mean I think it   
1:01:24   
would be really fascinating to get at both you know how they would come to   
1:01:29   
that kind of conclusion and as well as you know kind of speaking to Susan's um   
1:01:36   
what was it actin ATP and um calcium calcium. Yeah.   
1:01:43   
Yeah. Like like you know how how much of that that particular cluster   
1:01:48   
um is is a part of that um you know ancient   
1:01:54   
profile. Um anyway a really really   
1:02:00   
fascinating group um of of results in this this this last paper. Um,   
1:02:08   
can you send those the Absolutely. Um, preferences. Yeah, sure, sure, sure. Can I put them   
1:02:14   
on the DVAORM slack or Yeah. Yeah, I can send it to Susan then from there.   
1:02:20   
Okay. Okay. Okay. I I've got your email. I'm sure Susan, if if you want if you prefer that.   
1:02:25   
Okay. Well, yeah, I I um I sometimes use Slack terribly.   
1:02:31   
I'm not very good at it. The The other really interesting and And I think I I only caught this from um you   
1:02:40   
know he's been doing this symposium on platonic platonic spaces.   
1:02:47   
It's like um anyway look it up. It's it's not as philosophical.   
1:02:54   
I mean um it's still very it's still tied to his   
1:03:01   
his uh experimental work but um uh but I   
1:03:07   
think he was he was trying to make the case that these cells can hear or this   
1:03:13   
this the anthropods can hear. Oh and and by that Yeah. And by that by   
1:03:20   
that he he means I I should, you know, every time he uses   
1:03:25   
language, I need to be careful. Yeah. Um that   
1:03:32   
it can feel pressure pressure waves. Yeah. You know, and and I I think, you know, I   
1:03:40   
think the way he wants to use them, it can like feel pressure waves and act on them   
1:03:46   
or, you know, Yeah. respon respond respond to them. I mean I think I think part of that response is   
1:03:53   
needed so that he can determine that they are hearing. Right. Right. So so uh I think he because   
1:04:01   
remember with the um with the pleneria he um when he caused the eyes to grow in   
1:04:10   
a new spot, right? He had to create some some apparatus to test whether they they   
1:04:18   
were functional, right? And um uh   
1:04:25   
that he he he was doing the same thing with the anthrobots and and sound um   
1:04:34   
well anything anything to survive. I mean if you can feel pressure waves Yeah.   
1:04:40   
Yeah. that would help you survive. Yeah. Yeah. And like like again like he we what   
1:04:46   
what's interesting right is that like this is the same you know like you can   
1:04:53   
take epithelial cells and you can get their transcriptto you know but in this this context   
1:05:01   
they've they've completely um completely changed their expression   
1:05:06   
profile and and you know have made themselves   
1:05:13   
um new functional, you know, again, like not new functionality, but like they've   
1:05:19   
like turned on functionality, if you take them out of their   
1:05:26   
environment, you will change their genetics. Abs. Absolutely. Their operating genetics.   
1:05:32   
Absolutely. And and you know, but it's it's it's I think he's you know, again,   
1:05:38   
like I don't know how I mean, I think there's Something obviously   
1:05:44   
really interesting in terms of um uh   
1:05:50   
finding this set that it wasn't um   
1:05:56   
you know finding this kind of latent expression profile.   
1:06:02   
Yeah. Now that that's interesting. I'd like to know what it was exactly. Right. Right. Right. So yeah. Okay.   
1:06:09   
We'll follow up. It's um it's hard to   
1:06:15   
it's hard to make time for this because it's like I'm still not quite sure what under what uh kind of project title do   
1:06:22   
you put this right like it's um uh you know it's it's   
1:06:31   
anyway like like do you put this under a kind of like argin of life um right   
1:06:37   
I mean it's it's like Yeah, actually you could. Um, right. It's it's a step up from the very   
1:06:44   
beginning, but it's it's in there somewhere. I I I just want want to add um we're   
1:06:53   
going to be covering this the new book by um Bla1 um   
1:07:01   
it's like blaze Agera or something. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Um   
1:07:07   
what what is intelligence? Yeah. Yeah. And and have you got the mechanical intelligence   
1:07:13   
in there? It's got it's got it's got a lot um and   
1:07:20   
I I I bring it up not so much about the book but just um um you know driving   
1:07:28   
kids to activities and things like that. like I've been listening to as many   
1:07:34   
YouTube videos as I could find and um and he's got a lot   
1:07:40   
I mean going back a long ways you know and and over a wide variety of topics   
1:07:48   
too. Um uh any any tense segreies? I I have trouble   
1:07:55   
finding anything on tan segrity on YouTube that explains more than just the   
1:08:00   
basics. There isn't anything really. Yeah. Yeah. I mean no tense um you know   
1:08:08   
that is he's a hard one to find you know um good   
1:08:15   
yeah good educational material on. I I I would say I I don't think he covers   
1:08:20   
that, but but I will say that like his work is is super eclectic and you know   
1:08:28   
like he'll deep dive on something about creativity,   
1:08:34   
music, you know, um um certainly   
1:08:39   
covering things things about um you know DNA and I mean gene gene expression and   
1:08:47   
thing things like that as well as you know I mean it's it's somewhat leavenish in his   
1:08:53   
in his broad uh um broad set of interests and um anyway   
1:09:03   
it'd be it' be good though thank thank you Bradley for the u   
1:09:09   
I forget who it was you sent a link about somebody having some questions about the book and   
1:09:15   
oh yeah yeah the there There was uh someone who responded to like some of   
1:09:20   
his stuff at a life conference. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.   
1:09:27   
Um he he he had a really interesting talk at um the Saint S is it called the   
1:09:34   
Sainsbury Welcome Center? Yeah. Yeah. It's like the neuroscience. Yeah. Anyway, that that was that was really   
1:09:41   
interesting. Um that was a particularly interesting one and um anyway just   
1:09:48   
coming coming back to this kind of you know um fundamental mechanisms of agency   
1:09:55   
right which which are um yeah and and you know   
1:10:04   
that that of course goes to single-sellled organisms as well.   
1:10:12   
Yeah. Um,   
1:10:17   
yeah. Let's let's follow up on that uh that last paper if there's   
1:10:23   
uh I mean of of Levens on the anthrobots. Oh, okay. Yeah, we'll   
1:10:28   
Yeah. Yeah. If if Blaze has if he has some short papers, that'd be great.   
1:10:34   
But yeah, we're gonna we're gonna cover that book in in see November 18th. So,   
1:10:39   
okay. What is this? Uh, this is San Francisco Cognitive Science Reading Group.   
1:10:45   
Okay. Yeah, tell me about that. Yeah. Yeah. We we've we've done a couple   
1:10:52   
um a couple Leaven papers or 11 co-author papers, but um but the the guy   
1:10:59   
who runs the group actually was on Blaz's team for five years.   
1:11:04   
Okay. So it' be interesting to see if he's got any uh if he's got any insight. He's he's a   
1:11:10   
deep he's a Google deep mind supposedly working on like ML   
1:11:16   
music and art which I think is is I still don't know what what that makes you a   
1:11:23   
product manager of. Yeah, I should try to get employed with   
1:11:29   
something to do with my my art and science. the um pictures in the   
1:11:35   
background here. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Lovely. Lovely.   
1:11:41   
Yeah. Yeah. Well, these these days you gota you gotta you gotta have work AI into the into the narative.   
1:11:48   
Yeah. You know, I mean, you know Yeah. Yeah. If you want funding   
1:11:54   
Yeah. Yeah. If you've got a startup   
1:12:02   
There's always some buzz word though, you know, like That's right. That's right. Transcript as many buzzwords as possible.   
1:12:07   
Whatever. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. All right. So, that's great. Um,   
1:12:16   
yeah. So, let's let's follow up on that stuff and uh yeah, we'll see maybe in subsequent   
1:12:24   
meetings we can unpack maybe some of that. Okay. Right.   
1:12:30   
Get registered for the the active inference symposium. Oh, yeah. Yeah.   
1:12:37   
Right. Well, it was good meeting. Uh, thanks. Have a good week.   
1:12:43   
Take care. Take care. Bye. Bye. As promised, this is the other paper I had for today. Um, this is a   
1:12:52   
paper on self-organized biotectonics of termite. So this is of course about   
1:12:58   
self-organized insect nests and self-organized   
1:13:03   
social insects and then biotectonics being a mechanism for changes in the   
1:13:08   
structure of the nest. So a lot of interesting people on this   
1:13:13   
paper guy who has done a lot of stuff on swarm   
1:13:19   
intelligence and social insects. um El   
1:13:26   
Mahadavan who uh has done a number of things in bioysics uh recently has done a lot of work on   
1:13:33   
lrangee and coherent structures in biology and then Alexander Hayden   
1:13:41   
people from Harvard people from University of Tome in France and then uh   
1:13:50   
you have people from Harvard both in organismal and evolutionary biology and physics.   
1:14:02   
So the abstract reads, "The termite nest is one of the architectural wonders of the big world built by the collective   
1:14:08   
action of workers in a colony. Each nest has several characteristic structural motifs that allow for efficient   
1:14:14   
ventilation, pooling, and traversal. We use tomography to quantify the nest architecture of the African termite uh   
1:14:22   
epicoteries uh lamininai consisting of regularly spaced floors   
1:14:28   
connected by scattered linear and heliloqual ramps to understand how these elaborate structures are built and   
1:14:35   
arranged. We formulate a minimal model for the spatiotemporal evolution of   
1:14:40   
these hydrodnamic fields, mud, termites, and pherommones. Linking environmental   
1:14:46   
physics to collective building behavior using simple local rules based on   
1:14:51   
experimental observations. We find that floors and ramps emerg as solutions   
1:14:57   
governing equations with statistics consistent observations of a laminite   
1:15:02   
nests. Our studies demonstrates how a local self-reinforcing biotech scheme is   
1:15:09   
capable of generating an architecture that is simultaneously adaptable and functional and likely to be relevant for   
1:15:16   
a range of other animal built structures. So it looks like they're hitting on a number of themes here.   
1:15:21   
What's interesting is it looks like they're going in the direction of the bronio coherent structures. They talk   
1:15:26   
about this sort of minimal model for spatial evolution of three hydrodnamic   
1:15:32   
fields and They're using mud, termites, and pherommones as these fields that intersect in these structures. Um, we're   
1:15:40   
linking then environmental physics to collective building behavior. So, you have collective activity of termites,   
1:15:46   
but also the resources that are involved in it. So, if we get into the paper a little bit, uh, they talk a little bit   
1:15:52   
about the termite uh, genus apical termies that they're talking about here.   
1:15:59   
um they typify this architectural complexity that you see in a lot of social insects. You see bees nests and   
1:16:06   
termite mounds. These termite mounds are native to the savas and forest of Africa. They construct small ovoid nests   
1:16:14   
of just 20 to 40 cm in diameter located 5 to 50 cm.   
1:16:20   
The nest structure must be efficiently constructed to be capable of passive ventilation and cooling   
1:16:26   
or remaining habitable and transversible by the termites within. Um, and so they talk about sort of how   
1:16:33   
there's a lack of centralized control. um that there's no way that any one   
1:16:41   
termite could have a sufficiently broad cognitive map that could provide uh this   
1:16:47   
sort of a master plan of this architecture an organizational structure that allows   
1:16:54   
everyone you know that that sort of directs all the other termites to coordinate uh this colony. So this this   
1:17:01   
has to emerge from collective behavior from individual termites doing local   
1:17:06   
tasks or contributing small parts of the architecture and the architecture   
1:17:11   
emerging from them. So this is kind of the idea here is that   
1:17:18   
termites acting only on their local conditions produce global warm.   
1:17:24   
So they get into the idea of stigm. So stigma G is where you have the sort of   
1:17:29   
collective behavior but it's expressed somewhere in the environment laid down in the environment and then that   
1:17:35   
environment is used as a feedback signal to the rest of the collective to continue building upon that. So if you   
1:17:42   
think about like if you have um if you think about ant colonies where they   
1:17:47   
build ant trails the ant trails are determined by pherommones. So the ants   
1:17:55   
will explore their environment, lay down pherommones, and as they lay down pherommones, those concentrations will   
1:18:01   
tend to aggregate in paths that go from some source to like maybe a nest to   
1:18:08   
food. And so they over time as they explore, they tend to take similar routes across the environment, laying   
1:18:15   
down their pheromone. And as that pheromone trail grows in concentration,   
1:18:20   
then that pheromone trail gets reinforced by ants kind of being attracted to it. So you can see this   
1:18:27   
stick merging mechanism, this feedback between things that are laid down on the environment and then cognition and   
1:18:35   
recognition of that signal and then uh you know reinforcement of that signal.   
1:18:41   
They're more fair being laid down. So they talk about the principle of   
1:18:48   
stigma defined as the spontaneous but indirect coordination of agents stimulated action   
1:18:55   
by the trace of previous actions left in the environment. And this is implicated in what they call   
1:19:01   
the morphogenesis of large structures that enclose the nest. Over the long   
1:19:07   
length and time scales of overall mound structure, the small internal tunnels and chambers within the mound influence   
1:19:13   
the mound's material paracity, med ventilation, and uh explain the coarse   
1:19:20   
features of the mound such as its shape, size, and temporal evolution.   
1:19:27   
So they actually were able to um collect, scan, and then analyze the   
1:19:32   
structure of these nests. So there here are some of the images here. These are the scans. They would take like the   
1:19:39   
nests on the ground. They would do like a 3D scanning of it. They would scan the   
1:19:44   
inside and the outside, capture this sort of form and then   
1:19:51   
you know once it was uh digitized they could then analyze it, manipulate it,   
1:19:57   
whatever. So they have these they've identified these   
1:20:03   
different nests. The one is called MIMO 80 and then the other is MIMO 14. So   
1:20:09   
they basically have two nests that they identified that they scanned in. And   
1:20:14   
they looked at the spacing and arrangement of the floors and ramps. You   
1:20:19   
can see the floors are here. these different levels and then the ramps kind of connect the floors   
1:20:26   
so that termites can move up and down the nest. So for each nest we assembled   
1:20:32   
series of 359 and 177 vertical slices respectively   
1:20:38   
measuring the thickness of the floors vertical spacing between floors and then looking at sort of the other   
1:20:45   
properties of the nest. Uh they noticed that there was a   
1:20:50   
consistent arrangement of floors. Positioning of ramps was measured using   
1:20:56   
the horizontal distance from each ramp to the nearest ramp on the same floor.   
1:21:01   
They found that this was uh actually ordered in the sense that it   
1:21:07   
deviated from the null model of randomly scattered ramps. So you could ask, you   
1:21:12   
know, are these ramps just kind of randomly scattered across the nest or are they at regular intervals? And it   
1:21:19   
turns out that they're more at regular intervals than Random, which suggests that there's this sort of architectural   
1:21:27   
style that they pursue. Even though they're not doing this from a master blueprint, they're doing this from sort   
1:21:34   
of their collective behavior. They're able to do this quite well.   
1:21:40   
And so now they have this minimal model of biotectonics. So we turn to a series of observations   
1:21:46   
to motivate a minimal continuum model for nest construction. So we model the spatial temporal   
1:21:53   
dynamics of three fields that depend on location denoted by the vector x and   
1:21:58   
time t. So the nest material density which is uxt scaled from no nest   
1:22:04   
material when mu equals z to fully compacted when u equals 1. So it goes from zero to one. And the uh the nest   
1:22:13   
material density is then uxt where you can range from zero.   
1:22:19   
The termite worker density is nxt and the pheromone concentration is pxt both   
1:22:24   
in units of mass per volume. These two fields jointly evolve according to a sense of conservation laws expressed as   
1:22:31   
the following differential equations. They show that in the appendix material termite workers and pheromone.   
1:22:39   
So they're working from conservation for first principles and they're watching these three fields evolve according to   
1:22:47   
this you know crosses where this architecture would be. So this is figure   
1:22:53   
two. This is the statistical analysis of nests. So this is where we see the different   
1:23:01   
nests MIMO 80 and MIMO 14. You can see the differences between them the ramps   
1:23:06   
and and the levels. And then what they're doing here is they're analyzing   
1:23:12   
floor thickness and floor spacing. And they're looking at distance and   
1:23:17   
millimeters versus frequency and percent. So distance and their frequency. So how often do you see um   
1:23:26   
you know structures of this size and so you can see for floor thickness and for   
1:23:32   
floor spacing you get these sort of unimodal curves. I wouldn't call them   
1:23:37   
normal distributions, but they're pretty close to something that has a mean and a variance   
1:23:43   
that suggests that there's some sort of mean behavior going on in the building   
1:23:49   
process. And you see this for both nests other than maybe for this nest a little bit   
1:23:56   
and for this one, but still then that's so that's B. A is or the   
1:24:02   
nest. B is this graph distance versus frequency. And then C is where we have distance versus frequency for the same   
1:24:10   
floor or adjacent floors. And in this case they're using a function a continuous function showing this uh you   
1:24:18   
know where you see this for the same floor you see this for adjacent floors and you get this sort of um   
1:24:26   
you get this diff uh difference. So for adjacent floors you have this   
1:24:31   
uh difference between the same more in this nest here in MIMO 14 than MIMO 80   
1:24:39   
but you still see some sort of difference there. So actually they give the differential   
1:24:45   
equations here as well and for nest material you have this equation here for   
1:24:51   
one termite workers have another equation and then pheromone is a third equation. Um   
1:24:59   
so for these differential equations um these two symbols t and z are the   
1:25:05   
differential operators in time and height respectively. Uh   
1:25:11   
the gradient symbol Nava symbol is the threedimensional divergence operator and   
1:25:17   
then the NAVA or NAB dot is the threedimensional divergence operator. NAV itself is threedimensional gradient   
1:25:24   
operator. So you have a gradient and a divergence operator   
1:25:30   
in in the equation here. So like in termite workers and in pheromone you have a threedimensional divergence   
1:25:36   
operator. In the pheromone and termite workers, you also have the gradient operator in different locations in the   
1:25:43   
term. So what that means is that nest materials don't have a gradient but   
1:25:49   
termite workers and pherommones have gradient. Okay. So in equation one, this reflects   
1:25:55   
the addition and removal of the nest material. So it's a sort of uh just this   
1:26:01   
differential rate of the substrate. Um the poor elastic diffusivity of dirt   
1:26:09   
g captures its capacity to settle under the influence of gravity. This term breaks the rotational symmetry of the   
1:26:15   
model equations and establishes a divine vertical orientation for the nest.   
1:26:21   
Equation two which is termite workers reflects the dynamics of termites carrying dirt or not carrying dirt with   
1:26:28   
a flux that has two components. First is an effective diffusivity that   
1:26:33   
is proportional to the amount of space and a chemotactic term that drives termite workers into open and low   
1:26:40   
density nest regions with chemotactic coefficient high. So remember they're   
1:26:46   
being guided by uh uh cheo, you know, chemical gradients. So they're using   
1:26:52   
pherommones to guide themselves around the environment to leave signals in the environment that they then follow and   
1:27:00   
and push dirt. So basically it's a it's a it's a communication mechanism.   
1:27:06   
The final term represents switching between N and   
1:27:11   
ADA plus and ADA minus with the pellet size K denoting the average amount of dirt transported by a worker. So again   
1:27:19   
we have this pellet size we have switching between uh different loads of that. And then   
1:27:27   
finally equation three which is the pheromone reflects the dynamics of pherommones as they diffuse with the   
1:27:33   
diffusion coefficient and are secreted into deposited soil age propellant and   
1:27:38   
degrade through evaporation at a rate. We note that the pheromone is relatively   
1:27:43   
nonvolatile and does not advected by the ambient fluid since the subterranean nests of   
1:27:51   
epicenteries do not typically have noticeable temperature gradients.   
1:27:56   
And so then we have for the rest of the model we have these two equations here building rate and removal rate. So   
1:28:04   
again, uh we're building and then we're removing.   
1:28:10   
And so yeah, we have this figure three which is the   
1:28:16   
biotectonic model that predicts force spacing and ramp emergence in ter. So   
1:28:22   
basically we have the nest material which is this UXT. We have collective motion of the termite   
1:28:29   
workers NXT. We have signaling via secreted pheromone PXT and then we have   
1:28:35   
this templating process where it's deposited in terms of the stigma as the   
1:28:40   
nest. So the nest material is taken by the termites and the pheromone is used   
1:28:46   
the communication signal and it's deposited in the nest. So the the pheromone tells the other termites where   
1:28:54   
to lay the pellet. They lay the pellet and then that signals more termites to   
1:28:59   
lay other pellets in other locations and then that just kind of works its way without any sort of centralized guidance   
1:29:06   
or architectural guidance. The architectural guidance I guess is limited to the pheromone   
1:29:12   
deposit and the location of that pheromone deposit and the existence of a   
1:29:18   
nest and how that builds up to larger and larger structures. And so we can see   
1:29:23   
this like one snapshot from the nest where you have these levels and ramps   
1:29:29   
and how gravity influences this and   
1:29:34   
how removal influences this and how deposition influences this.   
1:29:39   
Uh there's this uh building rate versus pheromone concentration. So the building rate as that increases pheromone   
1:29:46   
concentration increases linearly. However, the removal rate is flat and   
1:29:51   
has no effect uh on pheromone her ferrone concentration is no effective.   
1:30:00   
Then this shows kind of a threedimensional model here of edge dislocation   
1:30:06   
and screw dislocation and then how there's this slip plane. So you get these uh ramps by there being a   
1:30:13   
dislocation of the edges. So they have this model where there's sort of a slight dislocation in the depositing of   
1:30:19   
pheromone in this this graph representation in that graph or that   
1:30:24   
that this that displacement of the pheromone translates into a   
1:30:30   
threedimensional plane in this sort of slippage which is then the ramp and then   
1:30:36   
you can see this in the in this image of the mound termite mound   
1:30:42   
where you get these ramps. that result from this slippage.   
1:30:47   
It's a slip what they call a slip plane. So they were able to simulate several of these nests. Um and that's figure four.   
1:30:57   
And then that's that's the paper. So it's a very good paper. Um there are a lot of sort of implications of this a   
1:31:04   
very good model I think. So this model allows them to capture two geometrical topological features of termite nests   
1:31:12   
namely the regular vertical spacing of floors and the horizontal spacing of ramps on the same or adjacent floors as   
1:31:19   
well as the month-long timing of nest construction process. So this is just where we have this   
1:31:25   
feedback loop of pherommones and building and how that can be explained   
1:31:32   
by stigmary and um this sort of emerging process.
