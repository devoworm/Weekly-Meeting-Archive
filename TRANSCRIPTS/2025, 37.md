## TRANSCRIPT

Hello, Morgan. Hello, Susan. Hello.   
0:07   
All right. Welcome. Oh, good. I did I did find   
0:13   
a paper just right well this morning.   
0:18   
Oops. If I can find out where it landed.   
0:23   
Oh, here we go. Um, it's called feedback controlled epithel   
0:32   
epithelial mechanics emergent soft elasticity and active yielding.   
0:38   
Oh wow. All right. So this is feedback controlled epithelial mechanics   
0:45   
emergence soft elasticity and active yielding. So this is Christina Maretti   
0:51   
is a familiar name in this area. All right then. So the abstract let's go   
0:56   
over that. Biological tissues exhibit distinct mechanical and realological behaviors during morphogenesis.   
1:03   
While much is known about tissue phase transitions controlled by structural order   
1:10   
and cell mechanics, key questions regarding how tissue scale pneumatic order   
1:16   
emerges from uh cell scale processes and influences tissue realology   
1:22   
and that process remains unclear. So these a minimum vertex model that   
1:27   
incorporates a coupling between active forces generated by cytokeleletal fibers their   
1:34   
alignment with local trans uh with local elastic stress and solid epithelial   
1:39   
tissues. We show that this feedback loop induces an isotropic pneumatic transition   
1:46   
leading to an ordered solid state that exhibits soft elasticity.   
1:52   
Further increasing activity dreads collective self-healing leading to tissue flows that are correlated across   
1:59   
the entire system. Uh let's see and then this remarkable   
2:04   
state that we dub plastic pneumatic solid is uniquely suited to facilitate active   
2:12   
tissue remodeling during morphogenesis. It fundamentally differs from the wellstudied fluid regime where   
2:19   
macroscopic elastic stress vanish or stresses vanish and the velocity   
2:24   
correlation like remains finite control and trolled by activity.   
2:30   
Although altogether our results reveal a rich spectrum of tissue states jointly   
2:35   
governed by activity and passive cell deformability with important implications for understanding tissue mechanics and   
2:43   
morphogenesis. No there are images of the cells aligned   
2:51   
in one direction in one part of the tissue and then in another direction and   
2:56   
another part. Oh, so it switches direction kind of abruptly.   
3:02   
Yeah, it can. Okay. Between one one part of the tissue and the other and the cells are just aligned in one   
3:09   
direction and then for some reason they're aligned in another. So, but of course that can   
3:16   
change. Yeah. See if they have any good pictures in here or images. Okay. So this is a   
3:25   
a a schematic of the active feedback loop and active extensile stress   
3:30   
generated by cellular fibers on alignment with local elastic stress. So A is shape cell shape elongation.   
3:39   
So the cells elongate along some axis here. The blue uh hexagons are the sort   
3:46   
of the original shape and then the red hexagons are the elongated shape. The elongated sides.   
3:53   
That's what I wanted to study in my thesis, but I had trouble enough making the things stand up.   
3:59   
Oh, yeah. And not fall down according to the the software. Yeah.   
4:06   
Yeah. That that's that's what I wanted to do. Yeah. And without going into their   
4:12   
mathematical model, we have alpha and beta. We have um   
4:19   
cell deforms under active stress. That's alpha. And then that's an input. And   
4:25   
then uh fiber lines of the elastic stress which is beta.   
4:30   
And you can see that um then that leads to the cellular pneumatic order. So it's   
4:36   
like if you get uh you have stresses the cells deform the fibers align with this elastic   
4:43   
stress you know so there's active stress and elastic stress components and then that determines the pneumatic order and   
4:50   
I guess there's like some phase transition that happens in certain regions of the tissue that give it like   
4:58   
these shifts in pneumatic order. So you can see it's kind of changing its   
5:03   
orientation here. They have these little like sticks or lines underneath   
5:10   
down here. Uh B is a phase diagram where we have   
5:17   
effective activity alpha beta on the y- axis target cell shape index pia on the   
5:24   
x- axis and then the the phases in in this area isotropic solid which is in   
5:32   
the lower part of the diagram. Iso isomeorphic gases I guess   
5:39   
uh pneumatic gas above it. pneumatic liquid above that plastic pneumatic   
5:44   
solid which is this region that they say is this new thing that they've discovered in the paper and that's   
5:51   
actually we'll see this in a minute and then soft pneumatic solid underneath that. So plastic pneumatic solid is sort   
5:57   
of this region here in the green. It's high effective activity,   
6:04   
low target cell shape index. As the target cell shape index decreases, the   
6:10   
effective activity increases. And then this this figure here at the   
6:16   
right um see missing a bit here.   
6:22   
So these are the different uh sort of patterns that you see here. So soft   
6:29   
pneumatic solid looks like the thing on the upper left. It's kind of got this   
6:34   
swirl or this these whirls almost like fingerprints. They're all kind of uh   
6:42   
they're all five and six shaped u objects. They're hexagons. They're   
6:50   
pentagons. And they're kind of in this swirl like you can see the swirl here   
6:56   
where there's this you know they so they change direction but like it's it isn't   
7:01   
abrupt necessarily. plastic pneumatic solid. It looks, you know, has kind of this uh it almost   
7:09   
looks like a force diagram where I have my my screen saver for my Mac. iMac is   
7:15   
like this where it's got this kind of these orientations, but they kind of   
7:21   
curve and they're kind of opposed to one another. an interesting uh the kind of   
7:29   
the way the dynamics of this pattern then that's that's the one they're   
7:35   
proposing in this paper that they've discovered. Pneumatic liquid is more sort of these abrupt changes with   
7:42   
respect to the sort of the orientation and you can see the cells underneath   
7:48   
there. Pneumatic gas is like more chaotic than the pneumatic liquid which   
7:54   
is based on the yellow lines. Isotropic solid are these uh hexagons and   
8:00   
pentagons that are basically they look like they're sort of frozen in place. They look pretty uniform. Then the   
8:07   
isotropic gas for the cells are sort of squished but it looks sim similar to the   
8:13   
isotropic solid. So the isotropic state is, you know,   
8:18   
pretty looks, you know, maybe stable, more stable. The plastic pneumatic solid   
8:23   
looks and the pneumatic gas and the pneumatic liquid look more dynamic to me.   
8:29   
Um, yeah, the color map is the magnitude of pneumatic order parameter. So the   
8:36   
pneumatic order parameter is Q. The closer to one, the more purple it is. So you see a lot of purple in the isotropic   
8:43   
solid condition. a lot of kind of dark blue to purple in the pneumatic gas. Some dark blue to   
8:50   
purple in the iso or in the pneumatic gas and pneumatic liquid. And then the   
8:56   
soft pneumatic solid has these blue and purple regions only or dark blue and   
9:03   
purple. So you can see that they're in a they correspond to that Q prime.   
9:11   
Okay. Um let me see if they have any more details on their mathematical   
9:17   
model. Actually this figure two is interesting. Uh this is where we have this   
9:22   
trijunction. We have cell J and cell I and then the cell down here. And this just shows the   
9:30   
pneumatic the parameter we just mentioned which is this pneumatic order and then S   
9:39   
which is um shape an isotropy. So you have the order parameter Q and the   
9:46   
anisotropy S. And you can see that stress induced order. They kind of start   
9:52   
at one on the alpha beta scale and they go up S going up slower than Q. These   
9:59   
are curve linear functions. And that describes stress induced order.   
10:05   
And it's just kind of where stresses are applied to the system. And because they're already kind of joined together,   
10:12   
they kind of push the sides of the cell in different ways and they all kind of   
10:18   
have the same order. Then there's intrinsic order which is this here. This   
10:23   
again is Q order parameter S which is shape an isotropy.   
10:29   
And so um so you understand that shape an isotropy is where it's not isotropic   
10:36   
like you have differences in the shape and the differences in the shape will increase as the order parameter   
10:42   
increases in the first case. Now in the stress induced order in the intrinsic order uh the uh order parameter and the   
10:51   
shape ofotropy are kind of separated by about 0.5   
10:57   
units on the y ais and then s increases a little bit uh you know it   
11:05   
starts at zero and it increases a little bit more curve linearly than q but there might yeah the shape ofotropy is low the   
11:12   
order parameter is figure through these tissue snapshots of different activity you have for the   
11:18   
isotropic solid, the soft pneumatic cell and the plastic pneumatic solid. Um and   
11:24   
you have these different um values for S and Q. So the shape   
11:30   
andotropy in orange, the order parameter in green when it's isotropic, the shape   
11:36   
andotropy is greater than the order parameter. In the pneumatic case where there's a phase transition on the alpha   
11:43   
beta uh axis which is right around the value one for alpha beta   
11:49   
uh there's a phase transition where shape oftropy is lower than the phase transition and then you have in this   
11:57   
next so that's for the order parameters versus alpha beta and then for alpha beta versus mean velocity and t1   
12:04   
transition rate you have the isotropic solid the soft pneumatic solid those have the same sort of zero near zero   
12:12   
mean velocity for both the uh shape and isotropion order parameter and then   
12:17   
towards the uh end of the soft pneumatic solid regime and going into this phase   
12:22   
transition with the plastic pneumatic solid the order parameter increases along with the shape of an isotrope. So   
12:29   
you see this example here where there these two things happening kind of simultaneously   
12:35   
and you see that's how you see these patterns with a high Q value the high   
12:40   
order parameter we use the 2D vertex model to describe solid epithelial tissues and   
12:47   
additionally we endow each cell with a pneumatic degree of freedom to account for the cellular active fibers. The   
12:54   
mechanical energy is equation one which characterizes the shape and then the   
13:00   
rigidity and um this is just me the mechanical energy   
13:05   
needed to deform the cell. They use a voronoi model. So they're using kind of calculating out the cell   
13:12   
centrid based on these voronoi uh cells. So it's like you know you take a bunch   
13:18   
of centrids and you find the mean distance between them and then those are your cell boundaries. So that's and then   
13:27   
the vertex positions evolve according to overdampened dynamics.   
13:33   
Uh equation two is where we have uh the dynamics described by the uh is   
13:40   
described by the dynamics of the vertices and contrast to the cell centroidid based approach used in the   
13:45   
voronoi model. The vertex positions r subi revolve according according to overdampen dynamics according to   
13:52   
equation two where you have a friction term that denotes the force induced by mechanical energy. F I act is the active   
14:01   
forces on the vertices induced by the cellular pneumatic stress. It's formed based on the definition of couchy stress   
14:07   
which is here and three um where   
14:13   
uh V act J um where fak J represents the active pneumatic stress of cell J and   
14:20   
the summation is taken over the three edges connected to vertex I. So they're charact I guess they're characterizing a   
14:27   
trijunction here. Um in terms of stresses um here J and I denote the two neighbor   
14:33   
cells. So J and I here I think   
14:39   
uh oh cell J and the summation is taken with three edges connected to vertex I.   
14:45   
Here J and I denote the two neighbor cells sharing the interfacial edge E.   
14:50   
And NV is the units normal vector to edge E pointing from cell J to cell I.   
14:59   
Uh so they're basically constructing a network and they're saying that it's directional in the sense that the   
15:04   
stresses are moving from one cell to the other and they're using the   
15:10   
centrids as sort of the nodes of the network and the edges are the stresses   
15:15   
going to and from each cell. The active stress uh is created by   
15:21   
cellular fibers in four where Q subj is a symmetric and traceless tensor that   
15:27   
describes the pneumatic order cytokeleletal fibers such as actin filaments and microtubules organized   
15:34   
within cell J and then alpha is the activity. The positive negative sign of alpha corresponds to contractile   
15:42   
extensile cellular activity. The dynamics of Q subj which is symmetric is   
15:48   
at five where the two terms in this equation five describe the mechanical   
15:53   
driving and intrinsic intense tendency of the pneumatic order respectively. So   
15:59   
I guess the mechanical driving is this term with the beta in it and then   
16:06   
the mechanical driving of intrinsic tendency of pneumatic order is this last term here.   
16:12   
The elastic stress on cell J is given by six. The elastic stress on cell J is   
16:18   
given by six where LE is the vector of edge E and the summation runs over all   
16:23   
edges of cell J. Its explicit form is given in equation A1.   
16:28   
Uh the coefficient beta denotes the strength of pneumatic alignment along the direction of deviatoric elastic   
16:35   
stress. a negative uh or positive B drives qj to a line parallel   
16:41   
perpendicular to the stress. And so that means that you know depending on this beta factor it determines sort of the   
16:49   
orientation of this pneumatic order because you're getting a response to the order sort of   
16:57   
the orientation of the stress and it's aligning itself appropriately.   
17:03   
Given that cytokeleletal fibers often form supercellular structures and that protrusions or filipodia can probe the   
17:10   
local environment to the cell. So the cells aren't just these uh you know polygons. They actually have like   
17:18   
filipodia and they have these weird shapes and so the model doesn't really capture that. They're just kind of   
17:25   
making an assumption here. uh they're they're building from this sort of uh   
17:31   
you know you know a hexagonal or uh pentagonal model where you have you know   
17:38   
like a six-sided or five-sided system with a centrid and then they're just   
17:43   
adding on like okay we can consider that there may be some you know deviations of of that shape and then factor that into   
17:51   
the model. Yeah, I these are flat sheets, right? Because you have to have   
17:57   
a proper um adjoining sides like a   
18:02   
fivesided hexagon or it's not a hexagon. Five-sided   
18:07   
has to go with a sevensided figure or you end up with um 3D like   
18:14   
it'll buckle. Yeah. Yeah. So, these are all um packed as it were.   
18:21   
Yeah. That's what you'd call it. They they're packed so that they're flat,   
18:26   
right? Yeah. There are no gaps in between the There are no gaps in between the cells.   
18:32   
There are no kind of misalignments. They're all kind of aligned. They all kind of share boundaries and that you   
18:39   
get these trijunctions as we saw. So that and then but in real in real   
18:45   
cell sheets you wouldn't have that, right? You'd have like gaps. You might have weird alignments because they're   
18:51   
always moving the ripples like they'd be 3D. Yeah. Yeah.   
18:59   
Um and so then uh in the second term, the coefficient M controls the intrinsic   
19:04   
tendency of cells to act actively elongate and align with each other. A   
19:09   
negative value corresponds to a non-elongated state with a round polygonal shape while positive value   
19:15   
characterizes the state of an intrinsic cellular pneumatic word.   
19:21   
Uh towel Q denotes the time scale of the pneumatic evolution. It's proportional to a rotational friction. And then   
19:28   
finally seven which is the total stress on cell J um is stated in that equation   
19:35   
there. So that's it and then these are run in simulation and then we get this these   
19:42   
results. So again yeah we get these results here. Uh we have the plastic pneumatic solid   
19:50   
we have the onset of flow steady state flow. You can see the difference here.   
19:55   
Um they're just varying the alpha beta for the plastic pneumatic solid and then   
20:00   
varying the onset and steady state flow conditions. And then they show these defects. So they have the the circles   
20:09   
the circles are plus half defects and the triangles are negative half defects.   
20:18   
So that then just shows you in their simulation where they're getting these defects.   
20:24   
The lines the red lines in here and the purple lines are flow field conditions.   
20:30   
These are like the direction of the flows. So you can see they're changing direction a little bit. You know, you   
20:36   
have like areas where it's oriented right, left or right, left, right, and   
20:42   
then top down and then maybe some that are oriented diagonally. and they kind   
20:48   
of you know uh you know maybe they determine these defects maybe they don't   
20:54   
they don't necessarily see a correlation between where kind of in you can see in some places where there's a change in   
20:59   
direction uh at the onset of flow and then the steady state flow where when the forces   
21:06   
change direction they're defects so   
21:11   
that's I mean that I don't know much more about it than that it's just kind of the veloc actually this is a velocity   
21:18   
field, not a force field. So you have basically the shape axis and the   
21:24   
velocity. The shape axis is in red, the velocity is in purple.   
21:31   
Actually, in the the velocity field, you know, you see a little bit of unevenness   
21:37   
along the edges, but that's just because, you know, they have to draw the   
21:43   
the lines around the edge of the of the ma matrix. So that's that's what   
21:51   
we have there. That's I think one of their main results. What do you think, Susan?   
21:57   
Um I think you should go from from this to the real world   
22:03   
to see what's going on like compare. Um,   
22:08   
and I'm not sure what I should be studying in order to understand this   
22:14   
thoroughly. Um, it's coached in linear algebra as usual.   
22:21   
Um, yeah, I'm I'm missing a piece of   
22:27   
information. the linear algebra is sort of okay with me, but um   
22:34   
yeah, I just feel like I'm missing something. Okay.   
22:40   
Yeah, I I would like to know what like maybe I should send machete an email   
22:47   
saying, "What do I need to study to thoroughly understand this?"   
22:54   
Yeah. I don't know. She might answer. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, you know,   
23:01   
again, it's a model that starts from an idealized form and then, you know, they use like foroi tilings and they use   
23:09   
centrids and then they use these force and velocity fields so that you have these vectors. They influence then the   
23:16   
shape of those that matrix and you can observe defects and things like that.   
23:21   
But like in a real sheet, of course, you would have these like imperfections   
23:28   
that would emerge from just like the cells moving against one another or them changing their shape. Because when they   
23:34   
change their shape, they don't just go like they don't just move smoothly from   
23:39   
like, you know, like a hexagon to some sort of rounded object. they, you know,   
23:47   
maybe have uh transitional states where they have, you know, there's slippage on   
23:53   
the edges and so you don't have these perfect tilings often. They're also moving in three dimensions. So, they're   
23:59   
moving over each other or under each other or something. So, yeah, there's there's hills and ripples,   
24:06   
right, as they go. The displacement isn't uniform, I guess,   
24:11   
is the lesson. especially, you know, higher sort of velocities.   
24:17   
Um, so yeah, I don't know. Yeah. Well, I I would like to know more.   
24:23   
It does fit in with what I was studying. So, I don't know. Um,   
24:31   
I'd like to make like I might like to make a 10segrity model of that and then put it through its paces and see what   
24:38   
happens. Yeah. Yeah, if it would stand up and if the program wouldn't say that the building fell fell   
24:45   
over, I I might be able to do something. I'd have to loosen the parameters up.   
24:53   
Yeah, building the the cell sheet. Yeah, the building is the cell sheet and   
25:00   
and uh the finite element programs think the cell sheet's a building anyway,   
25:06   
right? Yeah. Yeah. Um well, Morgan and I were talking   
25:12   
about an interesting paper that we saw um they were talking about it Saturday   
25:18   
where it was actually a model that someone had proposed for like a machine   
25:23   
learning transformer replacement for a machine learning transformer. And so it was this network. It was supposed to be   
25:30   
like it wasn't a neural network but it was a network certain properties that had like it was a network with nodes but   
25:38   
it had elasticity in it and the elasticity was supposed to represent learning.   
25:44   
So like as the edges of the network kind of deformed they changed their length or   
25:51   
whatever that was supposed to be like um some sort of elasticity   
25:57   
that corresponded to learning but I was thinking and I have to present on this   
26:02   
more here but um I was thinking well this looks like a tenseity model and   
26:07   
keep in mind that it wasn't at all they didn't hadn't at all thought about tense segrity and it wasn't anything it was a   
26:12   
physic kind of a quai physical model, but yeah, it did did have a lot of those components. It's interesting.   
26:21   
Yeah. Yeah. Well, if you're if it ends up being a tense segrity, I can tell you   
26:26   
it can be sometimes difficult to work with. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like they kind of   
26:33   
got at this tense model from a different direction. It was weird. Weird to see, but interesting.   
26:43   
I'd still like to know what odd electricity is or elasticity is.   
26:48   
Odd el elasticity. Odd el elasticity. Oh, is that in the paper? I didn't   
26:55   
um I don't know if it was in this paper, but Oh, you can look it up. It just seems   
27:01   
strange to me, but seems odd. Yeah, it seems odd.   
27:11   
Yeah. I don't know.   
27:16   
Yes. Anyway, that that's all I have this week. Any that's the thing I found.   
27:23   
Well, that's great. Yeah. Well, thank you for that. That was interesting.   
27:29   
All right. So, let me move on here. Um, so I wanted to talk about this idea of   
27:34   
macular macroolecular crowding and thinking about this in cells. So last   
27:40   
week we were talking about something like this um and some models of of cells where you   
27:46   
know there's this crowding inside the membrane like you see have the nucleus   
27:52   
and then you have the cytoplasm and then you have the cortex of the cell and then   
27:59   
you know it's In a lot of models that you'll see in textbooks, everything is very orderly. You have the organels and   
28:06   
it's just like they show the space in interstitial space and everything is very clear to see. But   
28:14   
that's not how real cells are. What real cells do have is this mac   
28:19   
macroolelecular crowding. And so this is something I I kind of looked up and I   
28:24   
used the I don't remember what model this is but Google's AI thing that comes   
28:30   
up and I look at the summary and then like go and find some papers. So   
28:36   
this kind of describes um macroolecular crowding. So macroolelecular crowding in   
28:42   
cells is modeled as a phenomena where the high density of macroolelecules like proteins and DNA occupy a   
28:49   
significant portion of the cellular volume. They estimate is like 5 to 40%.   
28:54   
So remember you know the cell is producing a lot of uh RNA molecules.   
29:00   
It's producing mRNAs, mirnas. Um, and then it's also producing   
29:05   
proteins which are assembled at the ribosomes or you know they're assembled   
29:11   
in the mRNAs are assembled into uh amino acids at the ribosomes and the proteins   
29:18   
uh come from that. So you know it's a lot of stuff going on in the cytoplasm   
29:24   
and their estimate at least I guess from the literature is something like 5 to 40% depending on the cell depending on   
29:32   
you know the state of the cell. So I imagine that there are quiescent times when it's less crowded and busy times   
29:40   
when it's more crowded. But um you know so keep in mind that this is all   
29:45   
happening sort of in this cytoplasm in between the nucleus and the cortex and   
29:51   
you get this you know um basically it affects you know the the dynamics of the   
29:58   
cytoplasm. So we talked about condensates before in this meeting. So condensates are these sort of mac   
30:05   
macroolelecular clusters that um sort of precipitate out of the cytoplasm and it   
30:11   
could contain proteins or mRNA or whatever and those are kind of important   
30:16   
in biology for various things. Um and so   
30:22   
it's you know this is this is an important thing to think about. So uh this cell this part of the cellular   
30:28   
volume this sort of crowding this high density of macroolelecules   
30:34   
impacts the function of other cellular components for steric and thermodynamic effects. Uh so then they talk about   
30:41   
models how they use concepts like excluded volume to describe how clouded how crowding can do three things. The   
30:49   
first it's alter reaction rates by favoring reactions that result in more compact molecules.   
30:56   
two affect diffusion which can speed up some reactions while hindering others   
31:01   
and three influence cell signaling by affecting the concentration of reactants   
31:06   
available to membrane proteins. So cell signaling is another part of this where you need to have signals   
31:13   
coming into the cell from the receptors and then they go down into the nucleus   
31:18   
those signals and then they affect gene expression or you know they can also   
31:24   
affect the metabolic state of the cell. But of course when you have this sort of   
31:29   
uh crowding in the in the cytoplasm it it essentially is like kind of like uh a   
31:37   
you know cloudiness in the sky. Like you know we're on on the planet and we have an atmosphere which is kind of like our   
31:44   
cytoplasm for the planet. And well you know it's a bad analogy but you get my point. the more sort of more clouds   
31:53   
there are in the sky, maybe the more haze there is in the sky, the you know harder it is to get sunlight, the harder   
32:00   
it is to see the stars at night, that sort of thing. And so this can affect in   
32:05   
this case it can affect a lot of things going on. Um, anything from reaction to   
32:14   
cell cyc.   
32:28   
Yeah, that's uh the other article. It it's um sort of a cellular uh crowding   
32:36   
thing in a way because you're getting separation between um groups of   
32:42   
molecules. Just sort of a molecule sorting, I   
32:47   
guess, instead of cell sorting. It's that that's how I think of it anyway.   
32:52   
Yeah, that's great. Yeah, thank you for that. So, that's a poster.   
32:59   
Yeah, it's a poster, but there's other um a lot of other articles about um the   
33:08   
phase separation of interfaces inside cells like it's whole   
33:15   
topic. So yeah, then they have uh so that's   
33:21   
that and then people use computational and physics based models to simulate this. So there's some key concepts.   
33:29   
Excluded volume, which is where the volume occupied by macroolelecules   
33:35   
prevents other molecules from occupying that same space. So they're basically like, you know, they have a finite   
33:40   
amount of space. You have molecules once they're there, you know, there's a rate limiting effect where other molecules   
33:48   
can't be there. So if you have crowding, that just limits the number of molecules   
33:53   
that can be in a certain place in a certain location. Then there's volume fraction which   
33:59   
represents the proportion of total cell volume occupied by macroolelecules   
34:04   
typically 0.15 to 0.2 in a healthy cell. Models show that an optimal crowding   
34:10   
level exists to maximize overall reaction rates without becoming diffusion limited.   
34:17   
So you know if you have diffusion you know if you had like if everything   
34:23   
diffused you know would reduce sort of the uh   
34:29   
what you know the effect of that crowding. So if every macroolelecule diffused evenly across the cytoplasm,   
34:38   
you know, you would have maybe you wouldn't have this crowding, but the way it tends to work is that you have these   
34:44   
precipitates, you have these clusters that can interfere with processes and um you can   
34:52   
model this as sort of like a diffusion limited system and then diffusion   
34:58   
effects themselves. So the presence of large macroolelecules hinders the movement of other molecules. So again,   
35:04   
you know, if they're there, they can hinder the movement of molecules, especially if they're in a place where   
35:10   
that molecule needs to be. The effect is dependent on the size and concentration of crowers. So small crowers can   
35:17   
sometimes slow down diffusion or large ones at the same volume fraction due to   
35:22   
a larger surface area. So that's that one. And then uh This   
35:29   
talks a little bit about how models are used for gene expression, for protein   
35:34   
folding, for cell signaling and in vitro models.   
35:40   
And then of course there's some modelbased simulations where you get these simulations of crowers.   
35:47   
You get uh field effects observed. You get ion flux across cell membranes.   
35:54   
those kinds of models uh that show crowding makes the association of soluble macroolelecules with membrane   
36:00   
proteins much more sensitive to changes in cell volume than predicted by simple   
36:05   
mass action principles. So you know again   
36:11   
we have to think about kind of how these things are distributed in the cytoplasm to understand their their effects their   
36:18   
true effects. This is a p   
36:23   
this is a picture of the JCVI sin 3.0 uh synthetic cell. This is a model of   
36:30   
that cell. The uh JCVI sin 3.0 is a a   
36:36   
bacterial cell. So it's not a ukareotic cell. And they show they model this   
36:44   
crowding in this cell. We're in this this cell has a lot of crowding in the   
36:49   
cytoplasm. So this is a this is a digital model of the cell. It's kind of like the uh the cell cortex is like a   
36:58   
half shell and then you have the molecular component kind of spewing out.   
37:05   
So it's like cutting away the cortex and you see the inside of the cell and you can see all this crowding. So this is an   
37:12   
accurate representation of this crowding. Um, and this isn't a proarotic cell, mind you. So, it's not   
37:19   
the same as a ukareotic cell, but you would see a lot of the sort of crowding. So, you can't even see the nucleus. It's   
37:25   
just kind of like all these uh proteins and other macroolelecules   
37:31   
kind of in, you know, in formation here. So, this is just visualizing what this   
37:36   
looks like. So this is I'm going to go through a couple of articles that where they've talked about macroolelecular   
37:42   
crowding and and what they're thinking about in terms of what it is and how we can you know utilize it as a biological   
37:50   
principle. So this is this paper has underestimated role of macroolecular crowding in bioengineered in vitro   
37:57   
models of health and disease. And so um macroolelecular crowding or   
38:05   
MMC is a ubiquitous phenomenon of biological systems that is largely   
38:10   
overlooked in bio-engineered in vitrocellular models. This comprehensive   
38:15   
review examines a significant impact of both intracellular and extracellular MMC   
38:21   
on cellular molecular processes under physiological and pathological conditions. By synthesizing current   
38:29   
knowledge and identifying critical gaps in our understanding of this, this review highlights a need to incorporate   
38:35   
crowding into the development of in vitro models for studying health and diseases as well as for drug discovery   
38:42   
platforms. The pervasive nature of MMC in biological systems underscores its   
38:47   
potential importance in various physiological pathological processes   
38:53   
including protein aggregation disorders, cancer and vascular diseases. So they're   
39:00   
thinking about this uh macroolelecular crowding when it's pathological when it   
39:06   
does bad things to the cell. And so you can imagine how that could happen not just at the constraints I mentioned in   
39:13   
the summary but also kind of like if there's just way too much stuff in the   
39:18   
cell and so it interferes with like uh translation or it interferes with um uh   
39:27   
you know metabolic processes. So it interferes with mitochondrial function things like that.   
39:40   
Recognizing ubiquitous influence of MMC could open new avenues for therapeutic   
39:46   
interventions and deepen our understanding of fundamental biological processes.   
39:57   
The second paper is on sort of molecular crowding at the origin of life. This is   
40:03   
molecular crowding in early evolution and this is a short abstract. So they're   
40:10   
doing their experiments in proto cells which are vesicles and so they don't   
40:16   
have the same properties as like ukareotic cells or even proarotic cells.   
40:21   
There's basically these containers that you can put proteins into and they behave, you know, kind of like regular   
40:27   
cells in the sense that they can perform metabolic functions and things like that. Um,   
40:35   
and so the environment of proto cells might have been crowded with small molecules and functional and   
40:41   
non-specific polymers. So this is talking about the protoells at the beginning of life. U you know, you   
40:48   
didn't really have a cell. You know, you had cells was basically things that were   
40:53   
enclosed in a volume by some membrane. And you know, it wasn't like as complex   
41:01   
as even the proarotic cells we see today. They were proto cells. And so   
41:07   
life was just trying to figure out what a cell should look like. And this is kind of where this crowding may have   
41:13   
come from where, you know, you have these molecules that are doing things in the cell as opposed to the environment.   
41:20   
So they're protected by the membrane. Uh those proto cells then can serve as a   
41:26   
selective mechanism. So whatever is inside the cell can get things from outside the cell but it's through you   
41:33   
know maybe like pores or through receptors or things like that. So there's signaling there's a selectivity   
41:41   
and so um that's basically kind of where they're going with this.   
41:47   
We always had the crowding, but then we got sort of the more complex cells later. So, the crowding's always been   
41:53   
with us and maybe it's even an artifact of these early stages in cell evolution.   
41:59   
In addition to altering confirmational equilibria, affecting reaction rates, and changing the structure and activity   
42:05   
of water, crowding might have enhanced the capabilities of protoells for   
42:11   
evolutionary innovation through the creation of extended neutral networks in the fitness landscape. So neutral   
42:17   
networks are sort of a tool that people use to look at different equivalent   
42:24   
states of you know evolutionary change. So in terms of fitness you know there   
42:32   
are these networks that are sort of equivalent in terms of their fitness. um you know systems can explore these   
42:39   
networks different states in the network and um you know you can describe them   
42:44   
using a neutral node um I'm not going to get too much more into that but   
42:50   
basically the idea here is that you can have   
42:56   
you know you can explore the space more when you have these systems that can um   
43:04   
you know help the protocol along and you know give it adaptive capacities.   
43:12   
Okay, so that's that one. Um the next paper here is this is the   
43:17   
molecular crowding the history and development of a scientific paradigm. This was in a special issue of chemical   
43:24   
reviews of molecular crowding. So if you're interested there is a special issue on this   
43:31   
and this is the abstract. Uh so this is I'll get into the text abstract and the   
43:39   
visual abstract later. It is now generally accepted that macroolelecules do not act in isolation   
43:46   
but live in a crowded environment. That is an environment populated by numerous different molecules. The field of   
43:53   
molecular crowding is its origins in the far 80s I guess late 80s but became   
43:59   
accepted only by the end of the 90s. In the present issue, we discuss various   
44:04   
aspects that are influenced by crowding and the need to consider its effects. This review is meant as an introduction   
44:11   
to the theme and an analysis of evolution of crowding concept through time from colloidal and polymer physics   
44:18   
as we saw in the vesicle paper to a more biological perspective. So this starts   
44:24   
off as like a colloidal phenomena in vesicles. These, you know, macroolelecules are   
44:32   
sort of in there as, you know, kind of the functional   
44:37   
show of the ves   
44:43   
as the functional show of the vesicle. And then later on when you have cells uh   
44:49   
with with like nuclei and and   
44:54   
different types of functions um you then have these you know they   
44:59   
become things like condensates and other things and they serve a wider range of biological functions.   
45:07   
So this is basically this is their graphical abstract viscosity. So this is where they kind of   
45:14   
talk about the role of diffusion. Here you have viscosity, volume, exclusion,   
45:20   
molecular interactions which affect diffusion. They have these condensates and other uh macroolelecules in the   
45:27   
cell. They're diffusing outward and they're getting more dense and then   
45:32   
these are the factors that are sort of influencing that. So whatever kind of medium   
45:38   
constitutes the cytoplasm is going to affect diffusion.   
45:44   
If there are things if there are a lot of things in the membrane or if there are things clustered say along the edge   
45:51   
or near some organel then you know you can't also be there. So it's limiting as   
45:58   
to what can be where. And then when you have more density in terms of what's   
46:03   
inside there, it's harder for macroolelecules to move. So they get   
46:08   
sort of jammed inside that cytoplasm. And of course, then we're affected by   
46:15   
protein folding, stability, and aggregation. So macroolelecules aggregate into these condensates. It   
46:22   
sort of opens up space for other macroolelecules to migr to to diffuse.   
46:28   
Stability is where you know do you have like a stable environment? Is there stability of the macroolelecules?   
46:36   
Is there stability in terms of the you know the the function and then   
46:42   
aggregation which we just mentioned.   
46:49   
This paper is um macroo macroolelecule crowding in vitro in vivo and in   
46:56   
between. And so this just kind of talks about these heterogeneous and high   
47:01   
volume spaces. Uh so this is talking about biochemical processes. Biochemical   
47:08   
processes take place in heterogeneous and highly volume occupied crowded environments that can be considerably   
47:15   
influenced or that can considerably influence the reactivity and distribution of   
47:21   
participating macroolelecules. Here we summarize the thermodynamic consequences of excluded volume   
47:28   
and longer range non-specific intermolecular interactions for macromolecular reactions and volume   
47:35   
occupied media. In addition, we summarize and compare the information content of studies of   
47:42   
crowding in vitro and viv. We emphasize the importance of characterizing behavior not only of labeled tracer   
47:49   
macroolelecules but also the composition and behavior of unlabeled macroolelecules   
47:54   
in the immediate vicinity of the tracer. So they're looking at things that we   
48:00   
might be able to trace and and see where they end up in the cell and then things   
48:05   
around. Finally, we propose strategies for extending quantitative analysis of   
48:10   
crowding in simple model systems to increasingly complex media up to and   
48:16   
including intact cells. So, you know, using quant quantitative analyses to   
48:21   
sort of characterize and analyze this this crowding because it is important biologically and again   
48:28   
you know we usually build models we leave out stuff like this. we just say well you know there's a density of   
48:35   
macroolelecules and it increases and then maybe you know there's an upper bound to that and everything is fine but   
48:42   
it actually is in and of itself um very much part of the system and it   
48:49   
affects how the system operates okay I think that's it I think there's   
48:56   
four papers and the summary and um you know there are Other images   
49:03   
you'll see of macroolecular crowding like people have kind of thought about   
49:08   
this for a while. It's sort of like the is a shorthand for the complexity of   
49:14   
cells, right? Like you have this stuff in the cytoplasm. It's packed with things a lot of things going on in the   
49:21   
cell outside of the nucleus. Whereas inside the nucleus we also have condensates. We also have things like   
49:27   
that. But um yeah, so it's it's something   
49:33   
that a lot of models don't really consider and it affects the mechanics of the cell. Uh so that's that's that's   
49:40   
another uh thing we can put on that list of things that you know a cell should   
49:46   
have. It should have a centrid. It should have boundaries, but it also should have stuff inside of it.   
49:51   
That's what my model didn't have in it is it didn't have fluid. And I just I   
49:59   
asked well could I put fluid in it please? And the professor who is dealing   
50:07   
with my project said no. He just said it's complicates things but you can   
50:13   
easily put water inside um   
50:19   
a um a form like that. So, um anyway, um   
50:25   
I think maybe the the concern was like somebody,   
50:31   
uh yeah, did somebody answer that?   
50:36   
Um anyway, um what was I going to say? Oh, someone did. They they took a truss and   
50:43   
they put water in it and it just it slowed down its movements.   
50:49   
So that might be a good thing to um that might have helped its stability. So   
50:56   
that's another thing I could try with my model is to put water in inside this truss.   
51:02   
Yeah. Seem to seem to help its oscillations like it oscillates very fast without the   
51:08   
water and and slower right slower frequency with water in the   
51:14   
model. So yeah, I think yeah, there there is well what Susan was talking about I think there was a concern that   
51:21   
you don't want to model fluid dynamics for every cell in the simulation is it's   
51:26   
likely to be um an isotropic you know within the cell and then   
51:32   
heterogeneous across cells and I don't know I don't think we're dealing with anything more than like basically   
51:38   
laminer flows within a cell although as you saw with the you know the the   
51:44   
velocity ities the velocity fields as they're changing you might get local turbulence   
51:51   
but that's that's something that you know is not uh   
51:56   
that's something you know we can only model so much I guess okay   
52:04   
so do we have anything else before we go yeah I should put it all in a superco computer and see what happens   
52:17   
It'll crash. Yeah. Put 10 segr and a superco computer and it'll crash.   
52:22   
Yeah. Right.   
52:27   
Anyway, that's that's all. All right. I had my 10 segrees hang up my computer.   
52:34   
It they hung it up. I kept iterating 5,000 times and I finally turned it off   
52:42   
and turned it back on and then that worked anyway.   
52:50   
All right. All right. That's good. Thanks for attending. Thanks for the paper, Susan.   
52:58   
Hey. Yeah. All right. It's what I'm very interested in. Yeah.   
53:04   
See you next week. Okay. Bye bye. All right. So, I'd like to do   
53:11   
another paper. Um, this one is from the bioarchchive.   
53:16   
This is just published this week on the server and this is talking about the Asgard   
53:24   
archibacteria. Uh, so ascard arcanon with internal   
53:29   
membrane compartments. So as we recall from the three domain   
53:34   
model of evolution, we have bacteria, archy bacteria and   
53:41   
ukaria. And of course we're in ukaria, plants are in ukaria, fungi,   
53:47   
yeasts and all the rest. Uh but we're   
53:52   
actually closer to archibacteria evolutionarily than bacteria.   
53:57   
That is if you go back to luca which is the last universal common ancestor.   
54:02   
This lineage that comes from Luca, bacteria derive first. They split off   
54:09   
first and they form their different uh components of that cate such as green   
54:16   
non-sulfur bacteria, grandpositive bacteria, cyanobacteria,   
54:21   
so forth. The other lineage that remained then uh   
54:29   
was the common ancestor of archibacteria and ukarotes. So there's a split between   
54:35   
archibacter and ukarotes. What this means is that archibacteria are more similar to ukarotes. And if you look at   
54:43   
cells, those cells then are going to more closely resemble ukareotic cells   
54:49   
than bacteria cells. Although they'll have components that are uh   
54:56   
sort of basil or ancestral to ukarots. So that's kind of a background for this   
55:03   
paper and again let's think about macroolelecular crowding in the context of this paper as well.   
55:11   
So let's go over the abstract. The emergence of ukarotes from a merger between an arcanon and a bacterial cell   
55:19   
two billion years ago involved a profound change of cellular organization. So that's the other   
55:25   
component of this relationship is that ukareotic cells are basically the   
55:31   
combination of ary archibacteria and bacterial cell types. So this was the   
55:39   
sort of way in which ukarots sort of became ukarots and this is well before   
55:45   
that there was multisellularity. While the order in which different features the ukarotic cellar rose remain   
55:53   
a matter of controversy, most archal relatives of ukariots have recently been identified that possess homologues of   
56:00   
ukarotic trafficking machine. So again, this is the sort of machinery that you   
56:05   
see near the membrane where you have receptors. You have different pores and   
56:11   
you have things that are coming into the cell and those things are traffic to the   
56:16   
uh nucleus or traffic to other parts of the cell. So these archibacterial cells   
56:24   
have homologues of the ukarotic trafficking machinery, a complex cell architecture   
56:30   
and other traits. So these traits are very similar to the ukareotic cell and this is the one that we're going to talk   
56:36   
about here. The members of this film, the Asgard archa,   
56:42   
the prometheo, however, lack internal membrane bound compartments and therefore have shed a   
56:49   
little light on the origins of the hallmark ukareotic endomemembrane system. So here we report the cell   
56:55   
biological analysis of a member of hemodela archa caniditis ubaram umbour   
57:01   
cryptonum an enriched mixed microbial communities possessing a small genome   
57:06   
encoding few homalologues of ukarotic membrane remodeling machinery. Uh the species uh the cells of the species in   
57:13   
latestage cultures resemble previously described Asgard archa with extensive   
57:18   
solar protrusions. So they're very similar to the Asgard archa that people   
57:25   
generally use but they have different properties that are more ukareotic.   
57:31   
Surprisingly during early stages of culture growth this type of cell has fewer protrusions but possesses numerous   
57:38   
intracellular vesicles most of which have a luminal surface that morphologically resembles the outer coat   
57:44   
of the plasma membrane. These data alter our view of ukarioenesis by identifying a close   
57:52   
archal relative of ukarotes with a regulated endommbrane system. So we can   
57:58   
look at light microscopy of this. So this is kind of looking at the properties of the cell. Right? So this   
58:05   
is the cell body. This is the nucleoid, the cytokeleton. You can see the protrusions out here. So you have these   
58:12   
protrusions. So this is the cell body. This is a protrusion like this and then it's   
58:19   
meeting up with the cell. So the protrusions are generally used to move   
58:25   
fodia or you know they could be used to sort of u you know do other things in that   
58:32   
intracellular space.   
58:38   
G is showing a little bit more of the ribosomes. So they identify ribosomes   
58:43   
in the cell. Their cytokeleton is here and the protrusions are here. So you see their multiple protrusions.   
58:52   
This is a segmentation model where they segment out the different components. You have the cytokeleton, ribosomes, the   
58:59   
membrane and the cell surface.   
59:05   
This is more segmentation. They see more elements of the cytokeleton. I see cytosol in here, ribosomes and then the   
59:14   
cell surface with protrusions   
59:19   
and again the cytokeleton the ribosomes cell surface of protrusions granules   
59:25   
here. So they're identifying a lot of components of the ukareotic cell in these um cells.   
59:34   
This is a vesicle here. So in the light microscopy you have a vesicle. You see the vesicles moving around inside the   
59:40   
cell, trafficking things from the membrane into the inner parts of the cell.   
1:00:06   
Let's look at more light microscopy. This is an early stage cell culture. So   
1:00:11   
this is just showing, you know, the cells as they're young and they have a lot of the features that are indicative   
1:00:18   
of a healthy cell. So this is the protrusions once again. You have   
1:00:23   
ribosomes identified carbon support. Um you have vesicles here, cytokeleton   
1:00:30   
here. So this is the membrane. The cytokeleton covers the membranes. They're trying to image basically   
1:00:38   
that will tend to show kind of what that looks like.   
1:01:11   
So again, this is early stage culture. Here's a nucleioid. There's a cytokeleton vesicles. And then you can   
1:01:18   
see the segmented model where you have the vesicles, the cytool, the cytokeleton   
1:01:24   
ribosomes and then the outer membrane which is the cell surface here and the outer membrane   
1:01:31   
here. Okay. So that's the segmentation and then this is uh these are   
1:01:58   
and so these are ribosomes. So you see here the ribosomes along the edge they   
1:02:04   
look like little orange and you go here you can see that their   
1:02:11   
images here and then the model over here. So these are the ribosomes you have the 50 subunit and the 30 subunit.   
1:02:19   
So this is uh like like in a ukareote procariote you 70s you have 80s in   
1:02:26   
ukarotes. So the 50 subunit is here, 30 subunit is down here. The proteins are in orange   
1:02:33   
and the rna is in blue. So you see how the structure looks here. There's the   
1:02:38   
identified exit tunnel. So you know the mRNA goes into this tunnel where it's   
1:02:44   
then transcribed in amino acids and then turned into proteins. Then there's an exit tunnel that comes out that gives   
1:02:51   
the output of the amino acids. So this is um you know the basic structure.   
1:02:58   
They're identifying all these components. They're also binding sites. There's the tRNA E site and the tRNA P   
1:03:04   
site. You can also identify those. So they're just modeling this from these images.   
1:03:10   
And so here they're looking at vesicle diameters. So here they're using cryo imaging. So they're using they're using   
1:03:18   
cryo electronography to look at different vesicles and their sizes.   
1:03:24   
So you just have them arranged by size here by diameter. And so you can then see kind of the distribution of vesicle   
1:03:31   
diameters in different parts and the well the diameter for certain parts of   
1:03:37   
the vesicle. So you have the single inner and outer. You have their diameter   
1:03:43   
nanometers and you have the distributions. They're more single   
1:03:49   
vesicles than double or ones in outer inner. And then these are the   
1:03:55   
segmentation models of the single vesicles. You have an inner. So these   
1:04:01   
the inner vesicles are these circles within. Then the outer vesicles are these   
1:04:06   
circles on the outside. So they they kind of clarify this here.   
1:04:12   
So the outer vesicle here is in blue in the segmentation model. The inner vesicle was in orange. So you have   
1:04:19   
vesicles where you have sort of a ring which is the outer vesicle and then   
1:04:24   
vesicles within it which is the inner vesicle. Then you have these single vesicles in purple and trying to see if   
1:04:31   
they have any single vesicles here. They really have good examples of that. basically   
1:04:37   
um the single vesicle like this just with the sort of the ring   
1:04:44   
and then the compound I guess call them compound vesicles are less common but they have   
1:04:51   
this kind of structure inside and so this shows a a fogyny   
1:04:57   
of thermopola asgard   
1:05:04   
kyota which is looking at here. Uh we have the   
1:05:10   
this is the model that we're talking about paper uh the hamdala archa and   
1:05:16   
then that is actually pretty close to the ukaria much closer than some of   
1:05:22   
these other cells here in the proteola. Um you see that there's a greater   
1:05:28   
complexity of filipodia for example you have bacterial cells that are   
1:05:34   
I'll put next to it in comparison. So the uh loi archa   
1:05:41   
and the imal archa ethylodia they have they have these protrusions   
1:05:47   
they have the inner cell body they have the compound vesicles and those are all   
1:05:53   
things you see in ukareotic cells. You have the protrusions here. Um the the   
1:05:59   
filipodia, you have the compound vesicles and you have other organels.   
1:06:05   
And you also have the cytokeleletal structure which you see
