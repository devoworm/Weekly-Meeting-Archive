## TRANSCRIPT

Hello, Morgan. Hi. How are you? Good.   
0:07   
All right. Well, Susan, nice.   
0:14   
All right. So, uh, hope you had any updates, Susan?   
0:21   
No, nothing. Welcome. Uh, what do we get started? I think Susan sent me a paper on cell cell   
0:30   
mechanics. I'll have to go through that. Then we have another paper to go through. Um, this is a nice resource   
0:38   
here. This is the epithelial mechanics fan club. This is something that they did a lot of   
0:44   
posting on social media, but they have this organization here where they uh   
0:50   
it's early career researchers and they have a lot of interesting uh   
0:56   
social media threads on epithelia and and papers that are coming out. They   
1:02   
just have that thread or those threads kind of uh uh fed to this website. So,   
1:10   
you know, this is a good source of getting new papers that you know kind of   
1:15   
look interesting and then getting like a tutorial on them. So, this is something   
1:21   
on positional information. This is something on uh well this is   
1:27   
positional information and bits. That's an older paper. Um this is optimal   
1:32   
decoding of cellular identities in a genetic network and you know just there are no quite a   
1:39   
few papers that they've I've I've picked from here that have been really interesting.   
1:45   
So that's uh that's that this is the paper on cell junctions I   
1:53   
just told you about this is in tissue barriers. So these are cell cell junctions structure and regulation in   
2:00   
physiology and pathology. This is a review article. So they go through um a bunch of different   
2:08   
mechanisms um that are involved in these junctions. So let's see what they have to say in   
2:15   
the abstract. So uh in the abstract they say that epithelial and endothelial cell   
2:21   
contacts are established and maintained by several intracellular junction complexes.   
2:27   
These structurally and biochemically differentiated regions on the plasma membrane primarily include tight   
2:34   
junctions which are abbreviated TJ and anchoring junctions which are not   
2:40   
abbreviated while the adherence junctions which are AJ. So adherence is   
2:46   
AJ and tight is TJ and then anchoring   
2:52   
junctions are kind of generic. So just keep that in mind.   
2:59   
Um pro and so the adherence junctions or AJs provide essential adhesive and   
3:05   
mechanical properties. uh TJs hold the cells together and form   
3:10   
a near leak proof intra intracellular seal by the fusion of adjacent cell   
3:15   
membranes. So when you have cell membranes fusing together you have the seal that's the tight junctions.   
3:22   
So if we think about it as like a seal and then adherence junctions as like   
3:29   
this uh sort of adhesive.   
3:35   
We wouldn't use an adhesive necessary way to seal things. TJs hold the cells together and form a   
3:42   
near leak proof intercellular seal by the fusion of adjacent cell membranes.   
3:47   
AJs and TJs play essential roles in vascular permeability. Obviously   
3:53   
considering their involvement in several key cellular functions such as barrier formation, proliferation, migration,   
4:02   
survival and differentiation. Further research is warranted on the composition and signaling pathways   
4:09   
regulating cell cell junctions to develop novel therapeutics through diseases.   
4:15   
The current review article presents our current state of knowledge on various cell cell junctions, their molecular   
4:22   
composition and mechanisms regulating their expression and function in   
4:28   
endothelial and epithelial cells. So this is uh talking about this how   
4:36   
cells they're talking about ukarotic cells here uh cells encompass the fluid matrix and organels containing various   
4:44   
chemical and biological components are wrapped in the limiting memory. These   
4:49   
are the basic units of structure and function in life. The ukareotic organisms with much larger genomes and   
4:56   
proteomes are generally larger and more highly organized than proarotic cells.   
5:03   
Uh last week at the end of the meeting I did a paper on uh archibacterial cells   
5:10   
and there's some archobacterial cells there's a genus of them that have features that you also see in ukarotic   
5:17   
cells. is archery um archibacteria are   
5:23   
more closely related to ukareotes than proaryotes. So they have some of those I   
5:29   
don't know I don't think they have a common ancestry they may have a common ancestry but they have similar features   
5:37   
which means that you have u you know you may have convergent evolution and it may   
5:43   
be because there's some need in in systems that are more complex for these   
5:50   
types of struct uh more uh elaborate structures   
5:55   
cells make have tissues. Tissue comprise organs. Organs form organ systems and   
6:02   
organ systems work collectively to generate an organism and keep it alive. The increased organization within the   
6:09   
ukareotic cells have allowed the for the evolution of thousands of different types of dedicated ukareotic cell types   
6:16   
that perform specialized functions such as protection, movement, energy storage   
6:22   
or reproduction. And then they talk about how epithelia and mezenyim are the most important   
6:28   
tissue types in the metazone body with epithelium arising first in embryionic   
6:34   
development and mezeny evolving from it. The switch off mechanism of   
6:39   
differentiation and maintenance of epithelial cells exists. The tissues   
6:45   
produce all the organs of the body through mutual inductions and interactions. The differentiation of blastoirs into an   
6:52   
epithelial state is essentially the first coordinated activity an animal   
6:57   
embryo undertakes. And so they kind of go through uh a   
7:04   
little bit about development. And then uh they say furthermore cells of the eight cell embryo and mammals in the   
7:11   
blast stage of animals in general are composed entirely of epithelial cells   
7:16   
that are held together by cell cell junctions. So this is uh again talking about   
7:24   
holding the cells together into these sheets that form organs and and tissues.   
7:31   
Um and we need these kind of junctions to perform that sort of function that   
7:36   
intracellular function. So they talk about EPCs which I I guess   
7:44   
are what they call epithelial cells. That's the abbreviation they're going to   
7:49   
use. Uh epithelial cells from the epithelia, one of the fundamental tissue   
7:55   
units of the human body or as endothelial cells or EC's. So it's EPC's   
8:00   
versus EC's derived from the misoderm or a thin layer of squamus cells that form   
8:06   
the innermost structures covering the interior walls of arteries, capillaries and veins. So they have different   
8:12   
mechanical load or different mechanical uh potentials. They're dealing with   
8:18   
different types of loads. They're dealing with different types of environments.   
8:23   
While the basil side of these cells is attached to the basement membrane, the apical surface confronts the lumen   
8:29   
towards spacer blood and EPCs and ECS respectively. uh so you have you know in one case you   
8:36   
have flowing blood on the other hand you have space which I guess you know could be some environment that doesn't have   
8:43   
maybe a high flow rate these cells can collectively form the cellular sheets   
8:49   
that act as a physical barrier playing a protective role against the external microorganisms in animal and human life   
8:56   
forms cell barriers are established and maintained by the presence of several   
9:01   
types of intracellular junctions cell cell junctions themselves up with   
9:07   
the attachment and communication between the cells. So we have our cells   
9:13   
and they need some sort of communication. So it's birectional.   
9:19   
Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, I know a lot of cells are kind of like that where they have you can do this with stem   
9:25   
cells too. You put them under different physical conditions and they differentiate or they don't differentiate. So you can grow stem   
9:32   
cells under like on a patterned surface and you can get them to differentiate in one way versus another and it's just   
9:39   
they're adhering to the surface that's either you know rough or smooth and it's introducing physical forces there and so   
9:47   
yeah well it probably you know it is a way to kind of keep that regulated right you   
9:54   
need that that cell type if it differentiates away from that cell type you have a problem you have blockages   
10:01   
you have. Yeah. Where the surface is not porous. Well, it must be tolerant of   
10:06   
something because people with like uh clogs in their arteries don't like die immediately.   
10:13   
Die slowly. Uh but yeah. Well, yeah, it's true. Blood vessels, I   
10:19   
guess, too. If it doesn't have the proper flow through the blood vessel   
10:25   
necrotic, these cells can collectively form the cellular sheets that act as a physical   
10:31   
barrier playing a protective role against the external microorganisms in animals. Um, and so this is just kind of   
10:40   
in ukareotic cells of course or in uh I guess ukareotic uh epithelia procarotic   
10:48   
epithelia. Okay. Um, so you get this sort of uh protection against basically   
10:56   
infection or you know microorganisms doing something in there. So yeah,   
11:01   
that's good. Um, cell cell barriers are established and maintained by the presence of several   
11:07   
types of intercellular junctions. Cell cell junctions themselves can help with the attachment and communication   
11:15   
between the cells. uh separation of the intravascular and   
11:21   
extravascular compartments and the maintenance of cell polarity. So this is   
11:26   
all you know kind of things that you need to get differentiation and   
11:31   
development. Remember has to those cells have to sort of form this layer to begin   
11:37   
with. Then you have to maintain that over time   
11:43   
and you want to maintain you know tissue integrity. So if you lose your flow, you don't maintain tissue integrity. But as   
11:50   
long as you have this sort of homeostatic set of conditions, you maintain your flow.   
11:57   
Experimental evidence has suggested that protein protein interactions and the cytool of such transmembrane junctional   
12:03   
proteins modulates the extracellular action of the protein which achieves homophilic or heterophilic binding to   
12:11   
extracellular domains of junctional proteins on neighboring cells. So in this way a controllable   
12:17   
intracellular seal is created. So these are of course the junctional   
12:23   
domains such as adherence domains AJS and tight junctions TJs.   
12:29   
Okay. So that's what they're getting at. So these seals or these these junctions   
12:34   
are very much a product of function keeping cells together keeping their   
12:39   
identity stable. So this is a nice uh review article.   
12:46   
They kind of go over the different types of cell junctions   
12:51   
here. This is figure one. They have cell cell junctions. They divide into   
12:57   
anchoring junctions, tight junctions and gap junctions. Then you have here   
13:04   
adherence junctions, uh desmosomes, hemisesmosomes and focal adhesions.   
13:11   
So these are all different types of anchoring junctions. Vocal adhesions jun uh anchor the cells to some surface. Um   
13:21   
hem desmosomes connect the cyto connect to the cytokeleton by intermediate filaments.   
13:29   
Desmosomes connect to the cytokeleton by intermediate filaments as well. And they're used in different   
13:36   
contexts. And then adherence junctions connect to the cytokeleton by actins   
13:42   
and these are transmembrane proteins like such as cadherins and plaque proteins like cadence. So this is all   
13:50   
kind of you know adhering to things and then tight junctions are connected   
13:57   
to the cytokeleton like actins uh sort of like adherence junctions   
14:03   
uh they have except they have different transmembrane proteins and different plaque proteins. So the transmembrane   
14:09   
proteins here are oludin claudins and jams. Not sure what jams are but um   
14:16   
those are different proteins you'll read about in the literature. Um plaque   
14:21   
proteins include zo singulin simplectin and others. So these are all kind of   
14:28   
these tight junctions that form the seal that they were talking then gap junctions which are these electrical   
14:34   
junctions between cells. These are also sort of uh mediated by transmembrane   
14:41   
proteins called conexins. Okay. So, one thing about naming   
14:47   
proteins, they really do go for like kind of the function. They'll they'll name it something like that. Um then   
14:54   
where they'll give it an unnecessary acronym. All right. Um   
15:00   
so they're anchoring junctions with proteins present within. uh I talk about anchoring junctions   
15:06   
present near the apical portion of two adjacent cells just behind the uh tight   
15:11   
junctions. So they say figure two uh adherence junctions the primary anchoring   
15:18   
junctions protein complexes are formed by transmembrane adhesion proteins   
15:23   
called cadherins. Cadherins are particularly important in embryogenesis   
15:28   
in the direct anchoring of the stem cells to niche cells organizing the niche controlling cell division   
15:35   
orientation regulating uh signaling pathways and affecting the mechanics of the cells. So   
15:42   
this is kind of the point about cadherins is that they're important in setting up the tissue, setting up the   
15:48   
sheet that will then form this this functional surface that you know we uh   
15:56   
see in in the functional biology. So if we're looking at the surface of a vessel   
16:03   
or pa air pathway where there flow there are physical flows either of air or of   
16:09   
liquid those things have to be built in some way. They have to be built sort of in the maybe in the absence of that   
16:17   
force but they have to be set up so that when the force comes or the flow comes   
16:22   
then it can respond. So these are all important in embryogenesis.   
16:28   
uh setting up the niche and then the niche is the thing that is you know either built up or broken down by this   
16:34   
activity dependence. So if there's a flow if there's a continual flow of air   
16:40   
or liquid then it maintains its niche. If not it pops out of its niche and then   
16:46   
you get um sometimes you get cancer cells sometimes you get necrosis   
16:52   
sometimes you get aptosis things like that. All right. And then so this just kind of   
16:58   
goes through uh some more details about this. So there are a number of uh   
17:03   
sections here that kind of go into these different components and they describe them. They also describe a lot of the   
17:09   
molecular components. Uh you have of course a lot of key proteins and   
17:15   
signaling molecules and so they kind of go into that later.   
17:21   
This is figure two. So this is a connection of various titan anchoring junctions to the cytokeleton.   
17:27   
So if we look at this we have our endothelial cells these uh yellow   
17:35   
structures and they're kind of facing each other. Then you have these junctions here. So you have tight junctions here where you have actin   
17:42   
molecules on either end of the junction. You have then these uh zo proteins here   
17:49   
and they serve as anchors on the actin for these clawin molecules these oludin   
17:56   
molecules and these jam molecules. So these are the ones that we're talking about and those make sort of the   
18:02   
junction between the cells itself. So they make contact outside the cell body in the   
18:09   
intercellular space. And so I assume because this is actin there's a lot of movement here. It's moving back and   
18:16   
forth or it's it it provides this sort of motor on either end. And then this   
18:23   
anchoring junction here you have an adherence junction and a desmosome. So   
18:29   
the adherence junction again is an actin on either side an alpha and then on the outside of each   
18:38   
one of those you have a p120 molecule on the junction   
18:44   
side of that and then you have this kid   
18:50   
these kadherins that meet in the intracellular space and form the   
18:56   
adherence junction. adhere adhesive properties are made by the kid   
19:02   
but again you have these active molecules on the other side on both sides. So there's this potential for   
19:09   
like kind of motion or motor thing here. Um then the desmosome and the   
19:15   
interesting thing here to note is that it's a cadherin and not an actin on either side. So you have these uh   
19:23   
cadhirins and then you have the uh   
19:28   
the desmople plectin molecules on the junction side and you have uh   
19:34   
glycoglobin on the junction side and then you have these other molecules the   
19:41   
decimal colon and decimal gleon which form this junction where they're look   
19:47   
like they're sliding back and forth. Yeah, I mean that sounds   
19:53   
that sounds interest that sounds I don't know if that's uh what the or what the   
19:59   
um the consequence of that is I guess it's yeah you get this sort of stretch   
20:04   
and then when you need even more stretch like extreme cases you have the desmosomes by you know by functionality where it   
20:11   
just gives it the extra um you know it gives it extra functionality   
20:18   
yeah yeah J curve I think That's what you call it. Yeah. It gives it sort of an elasticity under extreme conditions.   
20:24   
It's like if you're pulling apart to uh things with a vacuum seal. It's like hard to pull them apart and then once   
20:30   
you do they pop, but it's like that, you know, and then this might mediate that   
20:36   
part where you're trying they're really trying to be pulled apart. Okay. Yeah. So, this is and then this is   
20:42   
the um the two cells, the yellow and then the extracellular matrix is down   
20:47   
here in the pink. And so when it's uh connecting to the extracellular matrix you have the   
20:54   
hemisesome and the focal adhesion. The focal adhesion being uh mediated by   
21:00   
actin and the hemidesome is mediated by cadherence.   
21:06   
So that's where we have that and then we have of course our our plectin molecule here on the junction side and then these   
21:14   
um what are these jam molecules uh or   
21:20   
integr integrine. So your integr then gap bridge that gap across the the   
21:27   
junction and then the focal adhesions and the hemi desmosomes mediate like how the   
21:35   
cell connects to the the substrate. Okay. So this is figure three structure   
21:43   
of a typical TJ claudin ECL extracellular loop. This is just kind of   
21:49   
like this uh this is the cytoplasm. This is sort of at the membrane where   
21:56   
you have these kind of connections here. It says transmembrane proteins in blue.   
22:01   
It's hard to see the text there. And then the uh I guess these are extra cellular loops.   
22:08   
And these are the NH terminal. This is the PZ PDZ binding motif. The CO   
22:15   
terminal. So you have these things outside the cell and then these loops outside the cell and then this extra   
22:23   
these this this these uh structures here are just the membrane. So you have these   
22:28   
transmembrane proteins that are mediating this these junctions and then uh this is an example of a   
22:36   
knockout where you have these are the types of clans and their mechanisms. You   
22:42   
have two knock or an example two examples of a knockout and two examples   
22:47   
of a wild type for barrier forming claudin and poor forming claudin. So the   
22:53   
barrier forming claudin in the wild type you see this and when you knock out I   
23:00   
guess you're knocking out CLLDN1 and CLLDN3. So if you you have normal function here   
23:08   
with barrier forming claudin and then when you knock that out you have   
23:13   
passage if you knock out CLDN1 you have skin dehydration. So this layer   
23:19   
is forming like skin. So if you can that the barrier between the cells is forming   
23:26   
a seal that um is keeping water within the the matrix there of the cells. If   
23:34   
that's knocked out, you get skin dehydration. If CDLN3 is knocked out, you get sweat leakage. So you just get   
23:40   
different ways in which this barrier is or the seal is compromised between the cells in this knock. So those are two uh   
23:49   
proteins that can be knocked out and they have different uh phenotypic   
23:54   
defects. Now pooring claw in so it's a barrier forming. So it's keeping things   
23:59   
in and keeping things out of this matrix. So you have two cells, there's a   
24:05   
barrier and then that barrier is acting as a seal or a protective layer. Then   
24:11   
the pore forming is where you have a pore and this is where you have selectivity going into that matrix   
24:17   
between the cells. So instead of a barrier you have a selective pore and   
24:23   
then of course if you have your knockouts things this ceases to become   
24:29   
selective. um you can have different u phenotypic defects here. So for CDLN10   
24:36   
if you knock that out you have nephrocinosis and then CDLN15   
24:42   
you have intestinal malabsorption basically defects of this um this   
24:48   
epithelial layer. So this is kind of showing the effects of   
24:54   
what happens when you knock out different proteins and showing that effect of a phenotype.   
25:02   
This is figure five. This is regulation of adherence and tight junctions by SRC and AKT. So this is again a pretty busy   
25:10   
diagram where you have uh different things going on here. Um you have these   
25:17   
uh junctions you have a tight junction adherence junctions you have here barrier leakage and um so you can have   
25:25   
leakage between these junctions if they're not properly formed you have these are basically cla   
25:33   
disruptions and those reg result from downregulation of claudin you also have   
25:38   
vadherin inter uh internalization which is again a product of the   
25:45   
molecular um millu in in one cell or another. So you can have under production of   
25:53   
different factors and they can result in this barrier leakage. Um you also have   
25:59   
different receptors on the surface and they lead to different things going on   
26:04   
here. Um and it looks like here that you know you   
26:09   
have this circuit this uh molecular circuit you have FOX13A   
26:17   
which is important in claudin regulation and you have SRC and MDA which are   
26:23   
important and vadhirin phosphorilation which leads to vcadherin function. Okay   
26:30   
so I think that's it for this uh review. Um they they have some concluding thoughts here. Um you know so   
26:39   
considering their involvement in several key functions of the cells including barrier regulation, proliferation,   
26:46   
migration, survival and differentiation. Cell cell junction junctions need to be   
26:51   
studied in more detail. They're apparent expressions are not only a   
26:57   
cause of several diseases but also reliable markers for diagnosing these illnesses. The current review portrays a   
27:04   
reciprocal regulation of AKT and SRC and the maintenance of adherence junctions   
27:10   
and tight junctions. That last figure was about like how AKT and SRC are um   
27:16   
are modulated by these molecular circuits. They're modulated by   
27:22   
receptors. They're modulated by um the need for junction between two cells.   
27:29   
Um however, these mechanisms have been studied in isolation and therefore it is not clear how   
27:36   
distinct signaling mechanisms cross talk with one another. So we haven't even talked about cross talk yet. We've just   
27:42   
been looking at these idealized models of function. Much work remains to define   
27:47   
the contribution of individual signaling molecules which can then be targeted by pharmacological or genetic modulation to   
27:55   
treat BP related diseases. Hence further research is warranted on the signaling   
28:00   
pathways involved in the regulation of cell cell junctions.   
28:08   
Okay. So that was that paper. Uh thank you Susan for bringing that up. It had a   
28:13   
lot of uh sort of you know classification a lot of useful information on junctions and they they   
28:20   
showed some experimental data basically just giving an a quick sketch of how   
28:27   
that that's all regulated and how you can end up with different pathologies   
28:32   
and and dysfunctions.   
29:17   
Okay. Yeah.   
29:23   
Yeah. Yeah.   
29:35   
Yeah. All right. Um, so yeah, that's that paper.   
29:44   
Why don't we talk about this one? Um, this is interesting. Um, this is called cell supracellular structural relations   
29:52   
solve the French f flag problem without graded molecular control.   
29:57   
So this is by uh Amy Shy and Ellen Rodriguez and and colleagues. We've   
30:04   
talked about Amy Shire and Alan Rodriguez as having they're doing a lot of work on morphogenesis   
30:11   
and systems and introducing some mathematical models in there. So it's it's pretty interesting work. Um   
30:19   
and from the laboratory of morphogenesis at the Rockerfeller University. So this is uh you know this is so they're what   
30:27   
they're looking at here is they're looking at the French flag problem. So   
30:32   
the the French flag problem is how you get sort of a French flag from sort of a   
30:40   
random array of cells. And so what that means is in morphogenesis usually we're interested in pattern formation.   
30:48   
And a lot of times in development that manifests itself in striping. So if you look at the Drosophilo model organism,   
30:56   
look at the models that they have in Drosophil development, you have this striping that occurs   
31:02   
where the segmentation is another way to think about it and that results from   
31:07   
these uh gradients that intersect these gradients and morphagens and they're   
31:14   
spatially restricted so that those boundaries are very sharp and you get   
31:19   
these stripes or these segments. ments that are very distinct. And so if you   
31:24   
think about the French flag, it's a series of stripes of different colors. And so that's what they mean by the   
31:30   
French flag problem. You have these stripes of different colors. And you know, how do you get the French flag   
31:36   
from basically random order, you know, or disorder. So this is   
31:42   
a you know self-organization problem and we're trying to understand how spatial   
31:49   
patterns of cell state emerge. So these stripes will have cells of a distinct state and they'll be separate from   
31:56   
another stripe where you have cells of a different state.   
32:01   
So the abstract reads the molecular characterization of tissue organization through spatial omix. And so they're   
32:08   
characterizing things through this the spatial transcripttoics or these spatial proteomic approaches uh   
32:16   
where you get local information like sometimes it's single cell information   
32:22   
um and it it tells you something about that process because different cells   
32:29   
represent different points in space or sometimes you can sample like a tissue where you can or like an embryo where   
32:36   
you can isolate different transcriptional profiles of different parts of space and then you   
32:42   
can answer questions like this. So we use spatial omics we can take a new kind   
32:49   
of look at the French flag problem. So Walert's French flag problem was about   
32:54   
how spatial patterns of cell state emerge. Here we address the skeletal pattern of   
33:00   
adjacent cartilage and soft tissue. So this is actually in a complex tissue   
33:05   
where they're looking at um cartilage and soft tissue within a skeleton. We   
33:12   
find that cellular and supercellular structures supracellular structures are   
33:18   
co-constituative and result in cell extracellular matrix and cell cellbased   
33:24   
structures that can cartilage and soft tissue fate respectively.   
33:30   
So this means that you have uh this canalization process. So things get   
33:37   
buffered or channeled into certain fates uh based on their context.   
33:43   
A bstability in these fate setting structures establishes pattern length scale and is sufficient to break   
33:50   
symmetry in the meantime. However, an adjacent epithelium through signals like went can locally seed the   
33:57   
bstability to ensure the epithelial adjacency of soft tissue. So basically   
34:03   
you have um different uh you have cells   
34:08   
and they're you know kind of don't know what fate they need to be in and based   
34:13   
on their sort of location in the in the tissue they are restricted to certain   
34:19   
fates and that sets up these boundaries between different types of tissue and   
34:25   
those boundaries are very important for function. So you have an epithelial on   
34:31   
one side of the boundary and then soft tissue on the other side of the boundary and that you have to get that sort of   
34:38   
adjacency correct. So you have to have the right cells on each side of that boundary. You also have to have you know   
34:45   
you can't have cells in between that aren't quite sure of their fate because   
34:51   
it has to be a hard boundary. you have to have epi an epithelial sheet and then soft tissue right adjacent to it for   
34:58   
functional reasons that's very important. So it's important to have the sort of uh mechanism that allows for   
35:05   
this boundary to be set up and to uh be sort of error-free.   
35:11   
Um and so um a bstability in these fate setting structure. Okay, we did that.   
35:18   
However, an adjacent epithelium through signals went and locally seed the bice stability. We did that. um rather than   
35:26   
acting in a graded a graded manner to provide positional information acts affects sulfate by promoting a   
35:33   
supercellular structure. So this is this uh wind is basically creating this   
35:39   
supercellular structure um and controlling cell fate in that   
35:44   
way. Together, these results support a solution to the French flag problem where fate pattern originates through   
35:51   
structural relations between cell and supracellular outputs.   
35:57   
So patterning actually is about these structural relations. So you have cells   
36:04   
and they're acting on their own. You have these supercellular mechanisms acting on the cells and you get this   
36:11   
organization. So that all sounds good, but let's look at the paper a little bit more.   
36:19   
So the uh the French flag model was introduced by Lewis Walpert and that's sort of the classical model for this   
36:27   
type of patterning in different structures. So again, you get this, you think of the   
36:34   
French flag, it's three stripes. Each stripe has a sharp boundary. And this is   
36:40   
the thing we need in tissues to distinguish between different types of   
36:45   
of tissue uh within the structure and perhaps different types of function. Uh   
36:52   
so they describe the French flag model is where differences in signaling   
36:57   
molecule concentrations generate subcellular positional information   
37:03   
across the tissue. So you're actually interested in subcellular positional information. positional information   
37:10   
being sort of this you know where is the cell what is it supposed to be at this   
37:16   
location and there are a number of schools of thought on this that positional information is key to this   
37:23   
sort of uh you know structure building um and then the question is well how   
37:29   
does it know exactly what its position is and so this is done through a   
37:34   
coordinated molecular activity at least that's how a lot of people have thought of this. So you get these differences in   
37:41   
signaling molecule concentrations where the cell can sense the concentration of   
37:46   
different molecules and know its location in this gradient.   
37:52   
And then of course there's a templating to corresponding structures. So if you   
37:57   
know your position then there's this sort of template you know you kind of   
38:03   
understand where you are in the template and then that's the fate that you take   
38:08   
on and it it's all that all sounds very cognitive but this is all sort of a cell   
38:15   
uh sensing its gradient and then knowing what the fate is supposed to be. It   
38:21   
might be done through thresholding or some other mechanism. And so this works out pretty error-free   
38:29   
um in development. Here we not identify novel mechanism for   
38:34   
the organization of compartments within a tissue that does not rely on graded molecular control. So the French flag   
38:41   
model is based on this graded molecular control concept. They're finding in this   
38:46   
case a novel mechanism which does not rely on this. Instead we find that fate   
38:52   
patterns originate through structural relations between the cell and supracellular levels of organization.   
38:59   
So in complex systems like organs the structure that form and potential and the potential for such structures to   
39:06   
reciprocally adapt in response to relations within and across levels enabling organizing processes that are   
39:13   
unique to biology. So basically we have the cell which is at this sort of lower   
39:18   
level of organization the supracellular which is this higher level of organization and I think what they're   
39:25   
doing is they're thinking about this in terms of like complex adaptive systems.   
39:30   
So you have these lower levels and they inform the structure of the higher level   
39:37   
but the higher level then constrains the lower level and there's this reciprocal information that or this reciprocal loop   
39:45   
that forms. So there's information guiding the supercellular level and these constraints from the supercellular   
39:52   
level constraining what the cell can do. And you see this again and again in   
39:58   
biology uh with these different levels of organization. So you know you how do you form a   
40:04   
complex structure that is repeatable and error-free or at least it's you know   
40:10   
repeatable in the sense of being very self- similar. Well, you get these different types of regulatory signals.   
40:18   
um you you basically um have it's it's basically   
40:24   
self-organization. Um and so that's kind of what they're getting at here. Um   
40:31   
and so uh these reciprocal relations enable organizing processes that are   
40:37   
unique to biology. Such adaptive and reciprocally causal relationships are   
40:42   
specific to living systems because they stem from evolutionary processes fueled   
40:48   
by adaptation and therefore may not be simply derivable physical or chemical   
40:53   
first principles. So again this is saying that you know this isn't like   
40:58   
chemically deterministic or physically deterministic. In other words, you know it isn't guided by physical constraints   
41:05   
alone. that isn't guided by chemical signaling   
41:10   
matrices alone. There are these need this need for adaptation um in you know maybe across species or   
41:18   
across orders you have a lot of conserved mo you know uh molecules you   
41:24   
have a lot of conserved physical processes. So if you see these changes across evolution then how do you get   
41:30   
these changes in in this in the same system? Do you get this through just merely through uh chemical changes? Do   
41:37   
you get this um you know maybe there are physical changes but those physical changes probably aren't that great. So   
41:44   
how do you get these uh you know evolutionary changes and the answer of course is through these kinds of   
41:51   
self-organiz or um complex adaptive systems. So they give this uh example. Unlike   
41:58   
living systems, water molecules do not fundamentally change within a snowflake as it forms. Nor do Lego blocks   
42:05   
transform as they build or as they are incorporated into a structure.   
42:11   
However, cells can adapt in response to the structures they build. Along these lines, while physical and chemical   
42:17   
principles and tools are fundamental for studying living systems, is exemplified by the power of mechanochemical   
42:23   
frameworks. additional principles may be necessary to fully capture certain   
42:29   
aspects of living systems. So this this part here cells can adapt in response to   
42:35   
the structure as they build. So as the structure is being built,   
42:40   
that structure then is continually kind of regulated by the structure that's   
42:46   
there. So, you know, it's it's kind of like if you think about maybe like a termite mound or an ant nest, you know,   
42:56   
uh the organisms are interacting. They're playing their role in building the structure and depending on the sort   
43:03   
of the state of the structure, continually building onto the structure is going to be affected by the sort of   
43:10   
the current state. So, the future state affects the current state. uh the same thing with a lot of other complex   
43:17   
adaptive systems where you have an initial condition and you build uh from   
43:23   
that initial condition in a certain direction and then depending on what those current states are they inform   
43:28   
future states. So if you have maybe the same starting point and you go in   
43:34   
different directions, you can end up with radically different types of structures, but the principles behind   
43:41   
the building of the structures are the same. The chemical principles and the physical principles are are basically   
43:48   
the same. It's just that you're going in a different direction. Um, and so that's   
43:54   
that's kind of what they're getting at. and they don't propose any principles that sort of govern that. It's you know   
44:00   
the best analogy like I said I can make is sort of these um emergent structures   
44:06   
that are built by social insects. I mean it's the best way to kind of visualize this. Then you transfer it to sort of   
44:12   
cell biology. And you know, you can kind of think of, you know, the cells as the   
44:18   
individual agents and then they're building something greater than some of   
44:23   
their um, you know, uh, epithelial sheet through kind of their interactions   
44:32   
and forming these structures and how the structures are put together.   
44:37   
So that's kind of where where we are with that. Um so a framing of tissues through the   
44:43   
concepts of ecology in particular a focus on the mutual and often simultaneous relations of structures   
44:49   
across scales in the associated organization may be a powerful complement to current mechanochemical   
44:56   
frameworks. So this is again where you have these uh sort of ecological models   
45:03   
that are basically you know complex adaptive systems. Um so in ecological   
45:08   
models you have trophic levels and you have interactions between trophic levels and you have this very some people call   
45:15   
it fragile but it's actually also quite robust uh set of relationships that can   
45:22   
persist and you know there are things where you can perturb it in certain ways and thing will collapse or perturb it in   
45:29   
other ways and the thing remains stable and this is not necessarily predictable   
45:35   
but it does provide this sort of um this sort of structure that is uh   
45:41   
particularly suited for living systems which change constantly.   
45:47   
Much in the way that ecies ecologists must be attuned to the adaptive behavior that occurs through reciprocal relations   
45:53   
within and across the hierarchy of levels of organization. There's an increasing need to examine   
45:58   
their ecology within tissues and organs. So a lot of times in um developmental   
46:05   
biology we use terms like niche in in cell biology in general and you know   
46:11   
niche is something that comes from ecology and it just means like sort of a local optimum uh for some organism that   
46:21   
you know finds its niche in in in an ecosystem and you have cell types that   
46:26   
have a niche. So you know there are certain conditions under which the cell type will thrive. And so this is kind of   
46:33   
this ecological metaphor. What they're saying is that you need to think about the e ecological metaphor more broadly   
46:40   
and bring this into like thinking about tissues and organogenesis.   
46:45   
While the aspects of living systems that set them apart from inorganic systems have been theoretically considered,   
46:52   
empirical examples are still limited. Without clear and concrete illustrations of the particular nature of the   
46:58   
structures and organizing processes across the levels and organs, our ability to grasp causality and health   
47:04   
and disease um and their successfully intervene may be limited. So that's kind   
47:11   
of what they're talking about here. Um let's go into maybe some of the figures.   
47:18   
So this is figure one. You have this messeny and ectoerm.   
47:24   
You have this development over time. And you have these stains where you have socks nine and twist and then this is   
47:31   
merged. You have this other image here which is uh where you have the expression over   
47:39   
time. So you have the ectoerm here. Then you have where there's differentiation   
47:44   
and you have sock 9 changing its profile with respect to twist. And then the   
47:50   
dappy stain here. This is uh this is spatial transcrytoics where you have   
47:57   
this uh profile by uh by radius. So in   
48:02   
microns. So you see that there's this as you go outward you have this drop off   
48:10   
and twist this drop off and dappy as you might imagine because the cell body is you're getting the edge of the cell   
48:16   
body. Then sock 9 increases here. So this is where you have socks 9 twist GFP   
48:23   
stain. So it's co-stained and you can see that here. And then you have   
48:29   
different types of tissue. Socks 9 uh for cartilage soft tissue. So for uh   
48:38   
socks 9 you have in cartilage you have more of that and less of that in soft tissue. For twist you have less twist in   
48:46   
cartilage but a lot more in soft tissue. So that's showing the spatial aspect of   
48:51   
of expression. You have dappy and cadherin. You have this comparison in cartilage   
48:58   
and soft tissue. Again, you have differences in terms of the tissue. So   
49:04   
they're characterizing the different tissues and gene expression across those tissues. The idea is that there's this   
49:11   
hard boundary between cartilage and soft tissue. And this is spatially distinct.   
49:17   
So we have this radius from you know a single point we can see these   
49:24   
differences in gene expression and then those are very distinct between cell types.   
49:35   
Figure two is where you have uh the supracellular level impulse for   
49:40   
cartilage fade activation. So again we have some molecular   
49:47   
characterization of this and then at the bottom they give the interpretation   
49:53   
which is where we have lin mezenine which is naive. We have extracellular   
49:58   
matrix which is knocked out. We have cell extracellular matrix calcium signaling where we get this this   
50:05   
difference in cell types and then we have the this turns into the cartilage progenitor and then there's this top   
50:13   
down causation which uh leads to the SOX9 positive cartilage cell.   
50:19   
we have then these other cells from the lime mezen that go down this other path   
50:25   
where when we uh block off this ECM we   
50:30   
end up with cells that are undifferentiated that are SOX 9 negative so that's basically what they're showing   
50:36   
sock 9 is sort of the driver of this process and given the ECM the presence   
50:42   
of an extracellular matrix and this calcium ion signaling you either get   
50:48   
these these uh very specific cells these cartilage cells with the sock marker or you don't.   
50:56   
So that's what they mean by top down causation that the extracellular matrix is playing a role here in uh shaping   
51:04   
which cells are going to be which thing. In this case it's shaping which cells are going to be cartilagynous and you   
51:10   
get all these cells that are cartilagynous. You start to get this early with you   
51:16   
know uh some cells differentiating and some cells not but then all the cells at the end of this process are   
51:22   
differentiated and have a strong positive signal.   
51:28   
Uh this is figure three. When activation of soft tissue fade is mediated by cell interactions and this just shows more   
51:35   
characterization. We look at the cartoon again they show a little bit more about this. So we have lin mezenine which is   
51:42   
naive. We have this transition to cartilage uh cartilagynous cell type uh   
51:48   
with sox9 positive marker. But then if we go to this intermediate stage and we   
51:53   
look at the cell cell interactions and we look at wind signaling. We have the soft tissue progenitor. So we uh take   
52:01   
some of these cells. We have these cell cell interactions. We introduce wind. we have soft tissue progenitor cells that   
52:08   
are twist positive instead of cartilagynous progenitors which are so sign positive. So you see that they have   
52:14   
this different shape and they have this different um thing that's being   
52:20   
expressed. So you see that there's this uh this cell that's in isolation. If you   
52:26   
add or if you overexpress went in that single cell it's twist negative. But if   
52:32   
you have a bunch of cells in a population, they're all together, they're adhering to one another, and you   
52:38   
upregulate wind, then you get these twist positive cells. And so that's the   
52:43   
difference is that they're in this extracellular matrix. They're all kind of joined by these junctions. And that's   
52:50   
their the sort of the higher layer that's that's constraining what these cells can become. So again, if you have   
52:57   
the cell in isolation, it doesn't respond to win over expression. it has to be in this cell cell in these cell   
53:04   
cell interactions to get the twist positive. So again this is what's   
53:09   
happening with you know in in a cell population you have these limb mezenine   
53:15   
which are undifferiated and depending on their local environment depending on how   
53:20   
the cells are interacting with one another they form these different cell types and you can verify that they're of   
53:28   
that cell type by their molecular signature. So this is top down causation. Figure   
53:36   
four is cartilagynous and soft tissue domains can arise in the absence of a spatially located epithelial signal. So   
53:44   
if we look at the bottom here well first of all we can look at dappy   
53:49   
and can encounter for task and the control and we can see that there's this   
53:55   
distance from ectoderm and microns you have this normalized mean integrated dappy intensity and it decreases   
54:02   
um but they show their their result here their model. So you have cellular motion   
54:08   
where you have pressure, stress and traction and you have gradients for all three of these and then you have this   
54:14   
ECM transport gradient which leads to extracellular matrix synthesis. So you   
54:20   
have transport in the extracellular matrix which is a gradient you end up with synthesis and this is a product of   
54:27   
pressure stress and traction at equilibrium. So you know there are all these physical mechanisms going into   
54:34   
cellular motion in the extracellular matrix. You also have extracellular   
54:39   
matrix mechanics. So you have viscosity mu which is the product of the   
54:45   
interfacial tension gradient the cell adhesion uh change in cell adhesion and   
54:51   
then what we call haptotaxis or movements based on touch or pressure   
54:57   
and then of course we have repulsion. So we have these physical signals, these physical cues. We have changes in   
55:04   
adhesion. We have this gradient of interfacial tension and that leads to viscosity. And then we have cell adction   
55:11   
and cell diffusion described by this differential equation. We have these   
55:16   
gradients of cell and cell diffusion that are additive. And then feedback mechanisms. We have   
55:24   
the cell extracellular matrix engagement. you have this differential equation that describes these gradients   
55:30   
here and then cell cell engagement. So the cell extracellular matrix engagement   
55:36   
is a single cell in response to its extracellular matrix. The second term is   
55:42   
cell cell engagement which is where cells are interacting directly in independently of the extracellular   
55:49   
matrix. And in this differential equation we have mixing which is a gradient adction which is a gradient and   
55:56   
these bstable kinetics which are part of both terms.   
56:02   
If we look at this here we have the difference uh so we have for extracellular matrix density and cell   
56:09   
density we have these different outcomes. So as we increase the t   
56:15   
parameter from 0.83 83 to 1.5 we get these differences in I guess   
56:24   
uh this this uh metric here which is more I guess more activity but it looks   
56:31   
different. Um and so yeah you see that like extracellular matrix density and   
56:36   
cell density give you differences in this as you increase this T parameter   
56:42   
this increases its activity. I'm not really sure what this is exactly showing.   
56:47   
But it's in relation to this model. So uh cell and ECM densities in control   
56:53   
micro mass simulation uh at three time points 0.83 1.16 and 1.5.   
57:01   
Um and so that's it's kind of what they're doing here.   
57:10   
This is showing wind concentration, extracellular matrix density and cell   
57:16   
density. And these are just showing the radial distance um and showing this uh   
57:24   
cell density and ECM density comparing the two. So with wind concentrations,   
57:29   
the cell density is this aqua line here and ECM density is this um   
57:37   
uh gray line. And then W is this purple line. So you see W decreasing with   
57:43   
radial distance, cell density decreasing with radial distance but remaining above   
57:48   
zero. And then ECM density increasing with distance after a radial distance of   
57:54   
two and a half. So you see the ECM density ra rising where wind or where   
58:00   
cell density is decreasing. That makes sense. Um and then wind is decreasing   
58:06   
quickly even before cell density drops off. And then this simulation you see a   
58:13   
similar thing and a similar thing here. So all these just show this relationship.   
58:35   
And then finally we can show this cartoon here where uh we have uh   
58:41   
fibonnectin around this structure here cell density twist is in in the inside   
58:47   
of the structure of fibonnectin and then the ectoerm is within that. So   
58:53   
we have these three conditions. We have low cell ECM engagement,   
58:59   
control and high cell ECM engagement. So in the control we have this pressure   
59:06   
from fibonnectin inside towards the ectoerm and this is putting pressure on cell density. In the low cell   
59:13   
extracellular matrix engagement, we have ectoerm cell density twist which   
59:19   
diffuses over distance and gets weaker as you get towards the fibonnectin layer   
59:25   
which is then more diffuse. In this case here which is highell extracellular   
59:31   
matrix engagement. You get this a lot more fibonnectin. It is migrating out   
59:37   
from this ring and it's moving outward and then you have the cell density twist   
59:43   
which is dropping off from its central source and becoming weaker as we reach   
59:49   
the fibonnectin and then the ectoerm. So they can model this for kind of a   
59:54   
average levels of extracellular matrix engagement low cell extracellular matrix   
1:00:00   
engagement and high cell extracellular matrix engagement. And it just shows you the results of that. So the   
1:00:07   
extracellular matrix is playing an important organizing role here.   
1:00:14   
Okay. So I think that's all for that paper. Um any comments or questions? I think it fits into the previous paper   
1:00:22   
and that it shows that these junctions play a role in extracellular matrix and   
1:00:28   
these relations between cells. And so you can imagine that there's this interaction between extracellular matrix   
1:00:36   
which is the stuff outside of these cell layers. The junctions are playing roles in regulating what maybe goes down into   
1:00:44   
the substrate, what goes down beneath the cell layer and what stays above it   
1:00:50   
and how those things are shaped and differentiated. All right. Well, that sounds great.   
1:00:59   
Um, yeah. So, I guess that's all for today. U keep keep thinking about this stuff and   
1:01:07   
uh send papers as appropriate, I guess. All right. Thank you. See you next week.   
1:01:15   
So, I wanted to finish up with this paper. Um this is a newer paper that came out of the archive.   
1:01:22   
uh has Renal Lambio and Ela Gerelli does this stuff with uh physics, bioysics and   
1:01:29   
physical aspects of the brain and things like that and Renard Lambio is does a   
1:01:36   
lot of network um science stuff. So these are um good people for this paper   
1:01:42   
because this paper is titled from reductionism to realism holistic mathematical modeling for complex   
1:01:49   
biological systems. So they're going to get into uh modeling   
1:01:55   
and some of the aspects of modeling, philosophical aspects, technical aspects   
1:02:00   
that we need to think about when we apply a model to a system. So the abstract reads, at its core, the   
1:02:07   
physics paradigm adopts a reductionist approach aiming to understand fundamental phenomena by decomposing   
1:02:14   
them into simple elementary processes. While the strategy has been tremendously   
1:02:19   
successful in physics, it has often fallen short in addressing fundamental questions in the biological sciences.   
1:02:26   
This arises from the inherent complexity of biological systems characterized by heterogeneity,   
1:02:32   
polyunctionality in interactions across spatiotemporal scales. So in the Shy and Rodriguez   
1:02:40   
paper, we talked about how they're using this sort of complex adaptive systems   
1:02:45   
approach where you have top- down constraints and bottom up information to   
1:02:52   
describe, you know, something like pattern formation. In this case, we're dealing with systems that are linear but   
1:03:00   
also have these emergent properties where you can't break all of the effects down or you can't explain them in terms   
1:03:08   
of reductionist uh using reductionist techniques and you can't explain them in   
1:03:13   
terms of uh fundamental units. So this is kind of some things like   
1:03:19   
heterogeneity and polyunctionality and interactions are all features of these kind of   
1:03:26   
emergent systems. Nevertheless, the traditional framework of complex systems modeling falls short   
1:03:33   
as its emphasis on broad theoretical principles is often failed to produce predictive empirically grounded insight.   
1:03:40   
So this is kind of a criticism of complex systems research where you know   
1:03:46   
we're kind of focusing on these broad theoretical principles. We haven't had   
1:03:52   
really good um empirically grounded insights. Some of this is due to a lot   
1:03:58   
of these models being very generic. So we can apply say like a complex adaptive systems model or a network science model   
1:04:06   
or some other model of emergence to many different types of systems and they   
1:04:11   
describe the properties of those systems. We can identify say for example emergent properties in um things like   
1:04:19   
chemical systems or social insect communities or developmental biology.   
1:04:26   
But you know finding the real strong predictive mechanisms that we can find   
1:04:32   
with reductionist techniques using those kind of general uh approaches   
1:04:39   
there there's a gap something's lacking and some of that is because we're using these models that are sort of you know   
1:04:47   
focus on the overarching dynamics. So it's easy to sort of build a p you know   
1:04:53   
very tightly uh predictive model for of a specific   
1:04:59   
system. You know you could apply um sort of a statistical test or you   
1:05:04   
could apply a specific hypothesis to one limited system and you can have good   
1:05:10   
predictions because you're focusing on sort of the properties in front of you.   
1:05:15   
But in this case we have this metaphor and we say there's this broad principle that we want to apply to the system and   
1:05:22   
you know developing a sort of a quantitative technique for that is hard because you have to   
1:05:29   
operationalize it across a wide range of systems and not all those systems are   
1:05:35   
equivalent but they may indeed exhibit these kinds of uh print broad   
1:05:40   
principles. So, it's a little harder to get these kind of empirically grounded insights from these when you cast your   
1:05:48   
net so widely and you're using these metaphors instead of actual sort of   
1:05:53   
operational tests. That doesn't mean that it's not worthwhile. It's just a different kettle of fish as they say.   
1:06:02   
to advance towards actionable mathematical models in biology. We argue using neuroscience as a case study that   
1:06:08   
it is necessary to move beyond reductionist approaches and instead embrace embrace the complexity of   
1:06:14   
biological systems leveraging the growing growing availability of high resolution data and advances in high   
1:06:21   
performance computing. We advocate for a holistic mathematic modeling paradigm   
1:06:26   
that harnesses rich representational structures such as annotated multi-layer   
1:06:31   
networks. This is the network aspect. Uh employs agentbased models and   
1:06:36   
simulationbased approaches and focuses on the inverse problem of inferring system dynamics from observations. We   
1:06:44   
emphasize that this approach is fully compatible with the search for fundamental biohysical principles and   
1:06:50   
highlight the potential it holds to drive progress in mathematical biology over the next two decades.   
1:07:00   
So this kind of gets into you know what we want to do. Um so they kind of   
1:07:06   
highlight uh some of these models uh that are sort of reductionist versus   
1:07:14   
some of the broader principles of complexity models.   
1:07:19   
So they use an example from um neurobiology. We start from one of the   
1:07:25   
most important breakthroughs in mathematical biology the hodgekin hxley model for electrphysiological   
1:07:32   
excitability. So, some species of squid possess a so-called giant axon up to 1.5   
1:07:38   
millimeters in diameter that controls water propulsion. By isolating this   
1:07:43   
large axon, Hodgkin and Huxley were able to insert voltage clamp electrodes in   
1:07:49   
very extracellular order ionic concentrations to develop a complete set of ordinary differential equations that   
1:07:56   
describe the propagation of electrical signals or an oral axon providing the   
1:08:01   
first complete description of the act action potential basis of all the communication.   
1:08:09   
So this is an example of reductionism and modeling and this assumes that a   
1:08:14   
complex phenomena can be described in terms of a series of simpler more fundamental processes. So for the hodgen   
1:08:21   
hops model the key assumption was that neuronal activity could be modeled as an electrical circuit with each component   
1:08:29   
of the cell being represented as an electrical element. This in turn abstracts away other subcellular and   
1:08:35   
biochemical processes. And so this has been very successful across the sciences.   
1:08:42   
Um you know we we know that many physical systems can be organized on a   
1:08:47   
spectrum spanning from the regular to the random and we'll get to figure one in a minute   
1:08:53   
but they illustrate that in figure one. It is well appreciated that the reductionist approach appears to be the   
1:08:59   
most effective at the extrema of the spectrum where interactions present c   
1:09:04   
present certain types of symmetries. At one end of the spectrum for systems characterized by regular symmetric   
1:09:11   
organization such as atoms in a metal crystal individual elements   
1:09:18   
such as atoms in a metal or crystal individual elements can be extract   
1:09:23   
abstracted away through continuum assumptions. So we can use continuum mechanics or   
1:09:29   
partial differential equations to sort of represent the broad population of   
1:09:36   
atoms instead of modeling individual atoms.   
1:09:41   
Uh then at the other end of the spectrum in order to describe random systems composed of enormous numbers of noisy   
1:09:47   
interacting components we can use statistical mechanics. So in this case   
1:09:53   
we assume that interacting elements are identical and we don't need to describe the   
1:09:58   
behavior of each element but we can describe sort of the mean behavior of those elements. And so the dynamics are   
1:10:06   
things we're interested in the ensemble. And so this is what and then we can use mean field approximations to   
1:10:12   
characterize an ensemble and that describes the state of the system without problem or without incident   
1:10:18   
because everything is homogeneous. And so between these two extremes   
1:10:25   
systems that for lack of a better definition are best described as complex. So these are where we have   
1:10:31   
topologically irregular interactions, heterogeneous elements, polyunctional   
1:10:36   
processes and evolve over multiple time and length scales. So basically anything   
1:10:42   
that is biology. So you can see the problem that in physics you have these cases where you can you know at least we   
1:10:48   
have a good characterization of these homogeneous systems of these   
1:10:53   
systems where we can drill down to like individual elements and then even in   
1:10:58   
with their Hajkin Huxley model we're dealing maybe with a biological system   
1:11:03   
where there's a lot of complexity we can remove a lot of that complexity and get down to sort of the basic physics of the   
1:11:11   
process are we missing something with Hodgekin Huxley I mean you know we may be missing things I mean Hudkin Huxley   
1:11:18   
is predictive it gives gives you good answers. It gives you, you know, you can characterize a lot of things with   
1:11:24   
Hudkinox, but it isn't doesn't describe the biology in the same way that maybe a   
1:11:31   
complex systems model, but the complex systems model might not be able to give you the kind of predictive power that   
1:11:37   
you would get out of the hodge. All right. So,   
1:11:43   
so they talk about this distinction between or actually it's a distinction between three things. You have the   
1:11:50   
purely reductionist model which gives you these sort of ab highly abstracted   
1:11:55   
models which are very uh atomistic and give you maybe really   
1:12:00   
good predictive power. You get these systems that are sort of averaged or   
1:12:06   
continuum systems which still have predictive power but rely on these sort   
1:12:12   
of homogeneous elements. So you have you know populations of atoms or populations   
1:12:18   
of cells that are all homogeneous and we can make certain assumptions about their constituency and we can look at the   
1:12:26   
ensemble. We can look at the average the mean behavior. But then we get to systems like biology   
1:12:32   
and you can use those first two models in biology. But you know for a complete   
1:12:38   
description of the biology you need to turn to a third system which are these complex dynamics. these complex systems   
1:12:45   
and we saw an example in the last paper in the Shy and Rodriguez paper where   
1:12:50   
they were looking at the sort of complex adaptive systems um or type of organization   
1:12:57   
and you know that was I don't know how predictive it was but it definitely was   
1:13:02   
demon demonstrable you could see the differences between cell types you could see the influence of the extracellular   
1:13:09   
matrix but we couldn't necessarily model it directly. I mean they were doing some   
1:13:15   
modeling but it wasn't exactly uh giving us a predictable outcome   
1:13:22   
was just kind of demonstrating what this process looked like under different parameter values.   
1:13:29   
So this is kind of where they're going with this. They have these three categories and then they are thinking about how those relate to predictability   
1:13:37   
and how they relate to sort of fidelity in description. So this is the spectrum interaction   
1:13:44   
models and mathematical models. So basically what they're trying to get at here is that you have this regular   
1:13:49   
regime at the left, this random regime on the   
1:13:54   
right, this complex regime in the middle. So the regular regime is defined   
1:14:01   
by this lattice. Everything is homogeneous. If I take one element, it can describe   
1:14:07   
any other element and the connections are uniform. So even the connectivity is   
1:14:13   
sort of um the same across the lattice.   
1:14:18   
And then random of course is the opposite of that which is where you have   
1:14:24   
random positions. The uh connections in the lattice are   
1:14:29   
different lengths and the cells are all heterogeneous meaning they have different behaviors.   
1:14:35   
But it's not something we can actually predict because it's random and we can't really devise a statistical test to   
1:14:41   
deviate random random. We usually we do a statistical test. We look at the random case versus sort of the ordered   
1:14:48   
case. The sort of the control versus the treatment. The control being sort of a   
1:14:54   
random effect or no effect. And then the treatment being the thing with the   
1:14:59   
effect the the order. the the the experimental manipulation has the order   
1:15:05   
that we're looking for. And so this is regular, random, and then complex sits in the middle. So complex   
1:15:12   
has features of the random. It's heterogeneous. It's irregular, but it's also regular.   
1:15:19   
There's some regularities there. So that's what we're looking for. It's this complex regime. We can't   
1:15:25   
necessarily use reductionist set of techniques. We may be able to use some continuum   
1:15:32   
techniques or some ensemble techniques to describe the complex, but it doesn't fully describe it. And then to make   
1:15:40   
things worse, you have this regime between complex and random, which is term, for lack of a better term, the   
1:15:46   
edge of chaos. And so chaos being sort of the random,   
1:15:51   
the edge of chaos being at the edge of of the complex, shifting towards the random. It's sort   
1:15:58   
of systems that exist very very complex in very complex regimes very close to   
1:16:04   
being random but aren't random because they actually do generate predictable behaviors and other things like that. So   
1:16:11   
there's some order there and so but then you know there's this   
1:16:16   
continuous struggle to measure these things and to characterize them completely and that's what they're kind   
1:16:22   
of arguing in this paper that this is a very hard thing to do and they they kind of give some examples of how you do   
1:16:28   
this. So one example of a higher order   
1:16:34   
representation that they give is an annotated network. So you know if you think about a network   
1:16:40   
it's a simple structure it's a graph it's G equals V which is the vertex set   
1:16:46   
and the edge set combined to form a graph. Um annotated networks can provide nodal   
1:16:53   
metadata in the form of an additional vector of features D in D subi included   
1:16:58   
in RD that is attached to each vertex or to each edge. So to V and to E you would   
1:17:06   
attach this set RD which would give you   
1:17:12   
this additional information in G. So it gives you so it's basically   
1:17:18   
they say it's nodal metadata but it's really just like introducing heterogeneity into this graph structure.   
1:17:27   
And so in particular this extension allows us to model the heterogeneity of individual elements adding a crucial   
1:17:33   
layer of additional expressiveness to our mathematical models. Uh such an approach has proven useful in   
1:17:39   
neuroscience in the form of biologically annotated connetos which are human brain   
1:17:45   
networks obtained from structural imaging where each node or region is imbued with additional information such   
1:17:51   
as cell type density, gene transcription, receptor density and myelination.   
1:17:57   
And it's worth saying that this is, you know, kind of the standard in systems   
1:18:03   
biology where you have this network of molecules or the network of cells sometimes where you have, you know,   
1:18:10   
annotations available and you attach them to the nodes to describe sort of the things that are being expressed in   
1:18:16   
the cell or the expression values for different molecules or whatever. So it   
1:18:22   
gives you this additional layer of information upon which to act and have this sort of you know differentiation   
1:18:29   
within the network or you know whatever structure you're using and it gives you   
1:18:35   
this you know this this more gives more fidelity to your biological model. Open   
1:18:40   
source software such as neurom maps facilitate the integration of this multimodal data into richer structural   
1:18:46   
representations. Such heterogeneity has been used to develop biohysical models of brain   
1:18:51   
dynamics that incorporate regional heterogeneity or variations in gene expression or synaptic strength or added   
1:18:59   
biological complexity in closer agreement with observed neural dynamics.   
1:19:06   
So this just shows these richer representations. You have networks on the left, hyperraphs which we've talked   
1:19:12   
about in the group which are nodes within nodes and you know you have hyper edges within edges or edges within hyper   
1:19:21   
edges. You have simple complexes which are these networks that form shapes. So this   
1:19:27   
forms a triangle and you can characterize the simpl the simplices as   
1:19:32   
different shapes that are formed by connections between nodes. So you have triangles, you have rectangles, you have   
1:19:40   
diamonds, things like that. Um those are not you know there's a type of   
1:19:46   
network analysis called motif analysis. This is not quite that similar but it's   
1:19:52   
basically describing your network connectivity in terms of the geometry in terms of the topology.   
1:19:59   
Then you have temporal which mean and we did temporal graphs this summer was   
1:20:05   
giadas work. Um and this is where the network evolves the connectivity evolves   
1:20:11   
over time. Multi-layer networks where you have different layers. They could be these different layers of organization   
1:20:17   
and biology from uh organs to tissues to   
1:20:22   
cells to molecular networks and they're all connected because those are all those networks are all related. So you   
1:20:29   
have these multi-layer networks and then annotated networks where each node has different values over time or different   
1:20:37   
properties which evolve independently. So you know in network science it's   
1:20:42   
interesting because there's this movement towards thinking about nodes is not just these   
1:20:49   
single units but thinking about the internal contents of the nodes because they often represent many different   
1:20:55   
things. they can represent um you know people, places, things,   
1:21:01   
objects, whatever. And the principle behind it is that those nodes no matter   
1:21:06   
what they are then connect to other like units and they form these patterns that   
1:21:12   
you can then through statistics through ensemble statistics and through other types of analysis you can understand   
1:21:20   
that system better. Is that predictive? It's somewhat predictive except that the nodes are have very different   
1:21:26   
properties. They have very different levels of complexity and everything else. And so there's been this movement   
1:21:32   
in network science to kind of think about how these networks are structured   
1:21:37   
and to think about different types of integrating different types of nodes and   
1:21:43   
integrating information within the nodes and so on and so forth. Hence all these different variations in network   
1:21:50   
representations. So they make the point here in turn the mainstream within these fields may   
1:21:56   
replace reductionist abstractions with richer representations that are capable of incorporating the heterogeneity seen   
1:22:03   
in experiments. To achieve this goal, integration with multimodal data is crucial, but it is worth noting that the   
1:22:09   
scaling challenges pro prove limiting to this point. Given a system with n   
1:22:15   
elements, the number of pair wise interactions scales at n squared. If we introduce higher order multi-layer   
1:22:21   
interactions, the parameter space scales at an even faster rate. N to the power of B roughly. Um so that's that's   
1:22:29   
actually like you know an exponential sort of rate of expansion of our model.   
1:22:35   
As a result, such overparameterized models are plagued by both lack of sufficient multimodal data and the   
1:22:42   
inference algorithms needed to fit them. However, as we progress into the age of big data, modern experimental techniques   
1:22:49   
are able to record multimodal data on an unprecedented scale, particularly in   
1:22:54   
biological systems. Moreover, moreover, novel techniques in computational statistics and machine   
1:23:01   
learning are able to perform parameter inference for such complex models using observed data. And so unlike purely   
1:23:08   
statistical models such as machine learning models, these systems have parameters that remain more physically   
1:23:15   
constrained and meaningful. So you know if we talk about like a six trillion parameter model in deep learning the   
1:23:22   
parameters that we're talking about are very different than the parameters we're talking about in these kind of network models   
1:23:28   
because we have parameters that are physically constrained meaningful world   
1:23:34   
or you know they have different uh they describe different properties of the graph itself.   
1:23:40   
Um this ensures the interpretability of complex dynamical models in a ways the usual concern about vonoyman's elephant   
1:23:47   
and its wiggly trunk. So that is in reference to this idea that Vonoyman had   
1:23:53   
of being able to predict or you know having like if I give you give me five   
1:23:59   
parameters I can model an elephant and with six parameters I can wake up   
1:24:05   
meaning that you can describe sort of a two-dimensional drawing elephant using a   
1:24:11   
uh polomial a fifth order polomial each order of that polomial is has a uh is a   
1:24:19   
parameter And then with that sixth parameter you can model the movement of the trunk part   
1:24:24   
of that diagram. And so you know if you just kind of model something with a high   
1:24:29   
order polomial you can describe any shape you want. And so the the sort of   
1:24:34   
the drawback of these highdimensional models is that you're just using so many   
1:24:40   
parameters that you're just kind of reproducing the the the object with a   
1:24:45   
description of shape maybe instead of the actual thing that you're trying to predict. So that's that's what they're   
1:24:52   
getting at with that. Um with accurate calibration on experimental data and efficient simulation on high performance   
1:24:58   
computers, detailed heterogeneous and elaborate models of complex systems can   
1:25:03   
make the leap from generic and descriptive to mechanistic and predictive. So then they get into   
1:25:09   
different types of models. Um this is interesting. This is spati temporal scales and Alzheimer's disease. Um this   
1:25:17   
is where we have a very complex disease with different you know presenting   
1:25:24   
different symptoms having different mechanisms and at different time scales.   
1:25:29   
So we have this uh we have space in meters and time scale in milliseconds to   
1:25:35   
years and so we see that like depending on what we're talking about we have different very different spatial and   
1:25:42   
temporal scales. So protein protein interactions occur in a very small space   
1:25:47   
at a very short time scale. Cell death occurs at a longer time scale at a   
1:25:52   
little bit larger space of spatial scale. Uh we have then dementia which is   
1:25:59   
maybe like 10 years time scale but in a very large space of the brain. We're talking about like a meter of the brain.   
1:26:06   
We're talking about the cortical sheet mainly and we're talking about how much of the cortical sheet is affected by   
1:26:12   
this one process. How long does it take to unfold? So you see that you know   
1:26:18   
there are these sort of manifestations of the disease that are at this large space and increasing larger time scale   
1:26:26   
but these molecular uh characterizations that are at smaller time scales um and   
1:26:32   
lower smaller spaces and so we can use simulation based modeling. We can do   
1:26:39   
agent-based modeling, personalized biomedical recordings, have you know   
1:26:45   
using an encilico model to look at those recordings and then building what they call digital twins of the process which   
1:26:53   
are you know so you have two things here. You have data informing sort of   
1:26:58   
highfidelity models and then agentbased models which give you the sort of possibility space. So you can use the   
1:27:05   
digital twins and simulate them in the agentbased model to give us the possibilities within our system. And so   
1:27:12   
finally I'd like to make a comment about some of the sort of the models they throw at you later in the paper. Um   
1:27:19   
there are different mathematical approaches which people use for different systems. Um they're kind of   
1:27:25   
getting at how to apply mathematical models in a way that is suitable to the   
1:27:31   
problem you're dealing with. So not every mathematical problem fits or mathematical model fits every problem.   
1:27:38   
Um you know you have different types of time series modeling you can use differential equations. You also have   
1:27:44   
hidden marov models which are good for finding latent variables and states. um   
1:27:51   
you have other types of uh dimensionality reject reduction or other   
1:27:57   
models to sort of understand higher dimensional spaces and reduce them to   
1:28:03   
lower dimensional spaces and so they talk about all that here and they talk   
1:28:08   
about that in terms of the representation so when you have so I guess I'll address this aspect too the   
1:28:15   
fundamental physics for biology uh we have argued that theoretical biology ology should turn towards complex   
1:28:21   
empirical models with predictive capabilities even if these models occasionally complicate traditional   
1:28:27   
mathematical analyses. Um this shift does not negate the importance of identifying fundamental theoretical   
1:28:33   
principles that govern biological systems but instead act to support that.   
1:28:39   
So we really need to think about sort of developing a theoretical physics for living systems. So we don't want to just   
1:28:46   
port things from theoretical physics to biology. We want to develop a theoretical physics of biology. And this   
1:28:54   
is based in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. And you know some of the things that   
1:29:00   
that brings us
