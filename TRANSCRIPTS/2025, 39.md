## TRANSCRIPT     
0:00   
All right. So, I want to talk a little bit about this book called The Art of the Soluble. This is by Peter Metawir, who won the   
0:08   
Nobel Prize in 1960 for his work in medicine and physiology   
0:14   
on artificial organs and things like that. And this book was written around the time he won the Nobel Prize, perhaps   
0:20   
a little bit before. It's an interesting book because it's sort of um it it   
0:26   
reprints a bunch of different um books and gives his insights on those books.   
0:33   
So, you know, he was very strangely anti- D-Dian or you get the sense that   
0:38   
he wasn't he was trying to criticize Darwin for the sake of criticizing Darwin. He wasn't a creationist, but he   
0:44   
was like kind of a maybe the better way to put it is a contrarian. Um so that's   
0:50   
that's kind of where when I go through the book, you know, this is kind of the frame that I want   
0:57   
you to keep in mind. Cellular ability is this phenomenon in chemistry where if   
1:02   
you add some substance to say something like water, it will sit in solution at certain   
1:08   
concentrations, but at a critical concentration, it will become saturated and it will   
1:16   
fall out of solution. And so in this case, you have sugar and water. If you   
1:21   
add some sugar, you get uh sugar that's dissolved in water. It's suspended in   
1:27   
the water. And then eventually, if you add more, you know, enough sugar, you can get uh precipitate out on the bottom   
1:37   
in this sugar solution that's sitting on the bottom and then the deposited sugar   
1:42   
becomes greater and greater. So, that's a reference to the title. And then this is uh an example of Darcy Thompson's   
1:50   
work. So he focuses on Darcy Thompson's on growth and form book. And this is a   
1:55   
book that was published in 1917. So we're going to do very historical view here. We're going to view a book that   
2:01   
was published in 1958. Talking about a book that was published in 1917.   
2:07   
And so keep that in mind when we talk about these things because of course we're sitting in the year 2025 and   
2:14   
that's very different from these other time periods. So we're we're kind of like looking through the lens of two   
2:20   
other time periods in the past where they didn't have certain concepts that we have today. They had, you know,   
2:27   
different ways of thinking about biology and mathematics and things like that. So just keep that in mind. And then this is   
2:34   
Darcy Thompson's main idea in uncrowth and form which is that you can take   
2:39   
organisms and you can plot them out on these grids and you can describe the   
2:46   
morphology by looking at the grid and then looking at related forms and   
2:52   
shrinking this coordinate system or warping this coordinate system accordingly. So you see that we have   
2:59   
these different shaped I guess they're crustaceians or they're some sort of   
3:04   
insect their carropus and their carropus has different forms and shapes and so   
3:10   
they're being transformed. The initial example here is just a square cartisian   
3:16   
coordinate system, a grid, and then that grid is warped and deformed as the   
3:22   
different landmarks change their position relative to the original um   
3:28   
organism. So you see on the left there's this original reference organism and then to the right you have these other   
3:35   
forms that progressively change and you get these differences in the grid. in   
3:40   
the grid. Those transformations in the grid then allow you to mathematically describe or quantitatively describe   
3:48   
those changes. So looking at sort of the antenna, you know, some some of these   
3:53   
organisms have large antenna, some of them don't have any. And so that's going to affect the size of the grid. So this   
4:00   
is the idea that um Darcy Thompson brought to the four. It was very early   
4:06   
uh theoretical biology and at the time of course they didn't have computers to work these problems   
4:12   
out so it was a lot of it was handdrawn and it's an interesting book on growth   
4:17   
and form. My take on it is that it's mathematical biology. A lot of people think it's more mathematics than   
4:24   
biology, but what's interesting to remember is that it's basically a description of   
4:30   
form or shape without necessarily thinking about the   
4:36   
evolutionary biology or even the developmental biology to some extent because he does focus on, you know, this   
4:45   
sort of mathematical interpretation of life. And so we'll get into this in a minute.   
4:52   
So, it's also important to remember, like I said, we're dealing with history. We're dealing with different points in   
4:57   
time. Um, now what we're talking about with   
5:03   
Metawar's book and then Darcy Thompson's work is that there was no vocabulary in   
5:09   
physics for complex phenomena until the latter half of the 20th century. So,   
5:14   
we're familiar with terms like emergence or nonlinearity. Those weren't really common place in physics even until la   
5:23   
later in the 20th century the 60s and 70s we started to get these terms emerge and they describe things that they also   
5:31   
talk about here but they don't have the words for them. So I think that's a very important point when you have   
5:38   
uh some some phenomena you're looking at it's much easier to talk about it when   
5:43   
you have the vocabulary than when you don't. If everyone has to kind of describe it in their own way and hunt   
5:48   
around for the words and hunt around for the sort of mental model they need to understand what's going on, then it's   
5:55   
much harder to really give like a unified theory or a unified account of   
6:00   
what's going on. And this is a problem biology as well. So people often in biology, you know,   
6:08   
complain that something's too mathematical or something like that. It's not real biology. But it's   
6:14   
important to remember as well is that there is really no vocabulary that's biology specific for complex phenomena.   
6:22   
Even today, a lot of uh the vocabulary that we use to describe things like   
6:27   
emergence and nonlinearity and biology are borrowed from physics. And so biology being its own domain   
6:35   
maybe requires its own language or vocabulary of complexity as opposed to   
6:41   
just simply borrowing from physics. Those are all important points that we're going to get to in a in a moment.   
6:47   
So this is art of the soluble published first in 1958. Um and so that's the era we're talking   
6:54   
about. This is this book. It's not that thick, but it's a reproduction of   
7:00   
several books with Metawir's critique and his comments in embedded.   
7:06   
This uh book serves as a critique of biological theory up to that point. So he talks about Spencer, he talks about   
7:13   
uh Darcy Thompson, he talks about Darwin a lot. He was kind of bizarrely anti-Darwinian   
7:19   
if you read it. Not that he was a creationist, but you have to remember that Darwin um you know when he   
7:26   
published on origin of the species there were a lot of people who you know were   
7:32   
not really accepting of it right away. And you know you had later developments   
7:38   
which led kind of culminated into say like the neocynthesis which didn't come   
7:43   
until like the 1930s or 1940s. And it was well known that the German   
7:48   
embryologists for example were not Darwinians. In fact they didn't accept Darwin's uh origin of the species at   
7:56   
all. They had their own sort of uh agenda and they went with that. And you   
8:01   
know Darcy Thompson being a morphologist being interested in development also   
8:07   
didn't really use Darwin as the basis for a lot of his things. So it can be interpreted sort of as maybe   
8:13   
non-biological and in fact it was sort of pre- Darwinian work in truth but   
8:19   
metaware also had you know is kind of I I don't know is anti- Darwinian is very critical of Darwin both in this book art   
8:26   
of the soluble you know kind of directly addressing you know uh things about I   
8:32   
think there's a chapter called Darwin's illness which is about like Darwin's preoccupation with sex or something like   
8:40   
uh two, you know, concepts that, you know, didn't necessarily square away with what Meto was thinking. So,   
8:48   
in any case, he does focus on this book on growth and form. This was first published in 1917. It was a sort of a   
8:54   
comment, but it was also a thousand pages long, so there's no shortage of of   
9:00   
comment there. Um and so Darcy Thompson of course was interested in describing   
9:08   
development, describing morphology and describing changes in morphology. And of course we can do that with you know evo   
9:15   
today. We can do that with evolutionary theory. We can do that with uh computational biology and development.   
9:22   
Um but he had none of those things. And aside from that, um, you know, we didn't   
9:27   
have computers, so people really had to visualize things on pad and paper and   
9:32   
they had to draw things out. And so this is kind of an attempt at putting mathematics or mathematical cast on   
9:40   
this. So, you know, that's kind of where he's coming from. Um,   
9:45   
he actually had two conceptions of biological science. So he kept sort of the evolutionary which they called   
9:52   
Darwinian frame which was the ultimate level of causation separate and apart from the   
10:00   
anatomical or approximate frame of of causation. So if you look at the anatomy   
10:06   
of an organism it gets there through development that's different from   
10:12   
evolution which is the ultimate causation. And I know that you know if you think about evo devo that's actually   
10:19   
not the way they think about uh biology that those things are connected but this   
10:24   
is the way they thought about this and it's interesting that Nico Tinberg who is not necessarily a contemporary but   
10:32   
also published on this in the context of behavior talked about two levels   
10:39   
development which is proximate causation and evolution which is ultimate causation   
10:44   
And this has to do with behavior. How do you acquire behaviors? Is it   
10:51   
there is this nature nurture distinction but there also is this distinction between uh you know like behaviors that   
10:58   
you acquire within the lifetime and behaviors that you see across generations.   
11:04   
So that's interesting. Um but Thompson took a molecular and an anatomical view   
11:09   
of biology. He focused on the anatomy. He doesn't mention like gene pathways or   
11:16   
any of that other stuff that you know we talk about in Evo DVO, but he did have this sort of molecular view of life such   
11:24   
as it was back in 1917 and an anatomical view. So it's   
11:30   
interesting that that's mentioned in the book. And so if we take some of these ideas   
11:35   
and put them on a grid, we have approximate causes and ultimate causes.   
11:41   
we have molecular causes and anatomical causes or rather things that are expressed in molecular terms and things   
11:48   
that are expressed in anatomical terms. So this is kind of the framework that we can think about Darcy Thompson's work.   
11:57   
Now Darcy Thompson gives an example in his book about how you know some   
12:03   
biological structures are uh maybe not   
12:08   
the product of evolution. And so he talked about an example of the tbecular   
12:13   
bone. So tbeacular bone is a specific type of bone in the body. Um it he   
12:20   
talked about it as kind of being this thing that grows um in response to function. So is you know in the case of   
12:28   
tbecular bone is it an adaptation product of evolution that gets put down   
12:34   
you know in organisms that have acquired tracular bone as a trait and then you know it just kind of like is shaped by   
12:42   
fitness and things like that or is it an adaptive material which takes on its   
12:47   
shape in response to function. So in other words, if you know I'm an organism   
12:53   
that has very fast movements um or if I'm an organism that needs a   
13:01   
lot of reinforcement in my body, I grow my tbecular bone in ways that is   
13:06   
different from an organism that doesn't have those things. And you know, you might say, well, that's obviously, you   
13:12   
know, a product of it's an adaptation to the environment. It's something that we   
13:18   
can just account for through evolution. But, you know, you can also uh look at   
13:23   
examples where there's a lot of variation within like what we call life history. And so, this is kind of, you   
13:31   
know, showing uh Darcy Thompson's distinction between what's going on in   
13:36   
development or in life history and then what's going on in evolution and using evolutionary adaptation as an as a   
13:44   
descriptor of that. So it's about assigning sort of the cause. But you   
13:51   
know, weirdly, there is no experiment here to demonstrate this. It's just kind of like I'm observing morphology and   
13:58   
then I'm making decisions based on that and making kind of mental models based on that.   
14:04   
Um so in in his example the remodeling and   
14:09   
regeneration of tracular bone enable an environmental response but but of course   
14:15   
so this is only up to a point and this is something whereas today we call facultative adaptation which is you have   
14:21   
an adaptation that's a response to you know your interactions with the environment and you can develop these   
14:28   
facultative adaptations um and they look very much like evolutionary adaptations But they're   
14:33   
not. Another possibility of course that Darcy Thompson didn't talk about is this idea   
14:40   
of evolutionary encoding. So this is you know what would later be   
14:45   
sort of the standard explanation in Evo DVO where you have this evolutionary   
14:52   
encoding. In other words, you have these um you know these these life history   
14:58   
pressures, these interactions with the environment and they get encoded in terms of   
15:04   
heredity. So they encoded in terms of um   
15:10   
in terms of you know being encoded in genes. So this is of course where maybe   
15:16   
like force forces shaped the limbs of ancestors. this translated into some sort of developmental instruction that   
15:23   
was inherited in a mandelian form. So you know again   
15:30   
you have a bunch of variation in the ancestors those things get   
15:36   
selected for or sometimes you know you could have traits for plasticity they get selected for and you basically end   
15:45   
up with these developmental instructions that result from the fittest forms being   
15:52   
selected by natural selection and then you know that's what you have. So what   
15:58   
Darcy Thompson was observing was the end product of this evolutionary encoding.   
16:03   
It wasn't that facultitative adaptations are predominant and that evolution is   
16:08   
irrelevant. So you know again when you have the right vocabulary when you have the right   
16:14   
mental model for this it makes uh all the difference in the world in terms of the explanation that you use.   
16:21   
Another aspect and maybe it's very telling about Darcy Thompson's work is   
16:26   
that he had a pre-scientific view of development. So that pre-scientific view was often two schools of thought. One   
16:34   
was this idea of per preformation which is um   
16:40   
that should read preformation which is uh where you have readym made instructions.   
16:47   
So, it's like you have this little embryo that's going to form into a human   
16:52   
and it's just a matter of rowing and you know it's the the instructions are already in there. You just need to like   
16:59   
bake the embryo. And of course, that's we know that that's not really the case   
17:05   
that that's not a a that's not really the way things work.   
17:12   
And that was contrasted with epigenesis or fulfillment where there was a sort of   
17:17   
generative process by which the embryo achieved its form. So but this is still   
17:23   
all pre-scientific. This is not like you know the way we understand things today.   
17:29   
So we use the term epigenesis but it's quite different than the context in which they used it then.   
17:36   
And then um you know something that Metawir says is that Darcy Thompson   
17:42   
mistook the context of physical and mechanical forces. And so this idea that   
17:47   
I pointed out here where we have this environmental response versus an evolutionary encoding. He didn't really   
17:54   
understand the context of what he was looking at. When you look at something, things get there in a certain way. And   
18:00   
you have to understand that context before you can make you know kind of a a   
18:05   
a theoretical judgment. And so um physical and mechanical forces you know   
18:11   
are they acting in in life history and then that's the thing that determines the phenotype or is it that the   
18:18   
phenotype is pre-adapted so to speak to these physical and mechanical forces. So   
18:24   
like deep sea fishes for example have these very exotic morphologies. Is it   
18:30   
that they've shaped these exotic morphologies and development persistently or is it that they've   
18:37   
evolved to these exotic forms to deal with the extreme pressures and   
18:44   
temperatures and lack of light of the deep sea. And so this is the context of organisms   
18:52   
that were more specifically physical and mechanical forces on organisms that   
18:57   
Thompson, you know, maybe didn't understand. And so this is interesting because there's been later work in this   
19:04   
area by people like Adrien Behan and uh Mormon Mloud and others who have uh you   
19:12   
know kind of worked on this problem of morphology and and physical forces and   
19:18   
things like that and they've come up with some interesting ideas but again you know are they understanding the   
19:24   
context properly? um people you know who have background say in mechanical   
19:29   
engineering or in uh mathematics so they understand the proper biological context   
19:38   
another part of this and this is part of Darcy Thompson's book there was a chapter called a principle of heredity   
19:45   
so this is something where uh Dar Darwin and Mendle had a principle of heredity   
19:51   
actually Darwin borrowed Mendle's principle of heredity but Darwin said we   
19:56   
needed a principle of heredity. Thompson did not have this and this was kind of key is that there was no principle of   
20:02   
heredity. He didn't really accept Arwin's and he didn't really talk about mendle at all but he did talk about sort   
20:09   
of how you know development and evolution are separate and so that makes sense that like if you decouple   
20:17   
development and evolution you're not thinking about heredity as sort of the bridge between them. And so um you know   
20:24   
another thing he kind of thought about was he considered physical agencies as the basis for natural selection. So that   
20:32   
might be like where you have a set of forces in the environment and those govern the fitness. Are you fit enough   
20:39   
to be physically viable in a given environment? This still isn't a   
20:44   
principle of heredity but it basically is the way you view natural selection such as it was. you know this case   
20:51   
natural selection being the things that drive developmental plasticity.   
20:56   
Um so Thompson had a philosophy of living organisms. So basically a physical laws correspond   
21:06   
to organisms. Organisms that we observe are the products of physical laws. You   
21:11   
know we know that like genes code for things. He didn't talk about genes in the book, but he did talk about these   
21:17   
physical laws being the constraints on the shapes that organisms had. And then of course use these grids to describe   
21:25   
those changes. And you could have of course these uh deformations that could   
21:30   
be described with variations on this grid. And of course you could map that to physical laws. You could map that to   
21:36   
the effects of gravity or forces or stresses or strains or things like that.   
21:44   
And then the second part of the philosophy of living organisms was that living organisms do nothing to   
21:50   
contravene laws. So they cannot overcome the laws of physics. And so organisms   
21:56   
are totally constrained by physics and therefore can be described as physical   
22:01   
sort of entities and which you know we know that like organisms have to obey physical laws but I think he was   
22:08   
thinking in a more deterministic sense than that. Um now ironically he wasn't a   
22:13   
physicist. Uh he was just using a lot of mathematics to describe life but that's   
22:19   
kind of the the philosophy of living organisms.   
22:24   
Now he also had some thoughts on things like rate of growth which is of course now today known as a lometry.   
22:30   
And so uh and metawar points out that the way Thompson thought about the rate   
22:35   
of growth is very different than the way that say Huxley thought about differential growth or that we use log   
22:42   
scaling in modern alometry to describe sort of the difference in rate of growth   
22:47   
between two parts of the organism. So in a lometry, you know, we might look   
22:53   
at head size versus body size, brain size versus body size,   
22:59   
uh snout length versus tail length or snout length versus body size. Basically, the idea is that there are   
23:05   
certain parts of the body that grow faster and at a greater rate than other   
23:11   
parts of the body. And that's a product of evolution. And we can see that in across species and that can describe uh   
23:19   
evolutionary processes evolutionary change across different species in a   
23:24   
clay or in a comparative context. So you know you have to think in in   
23:31   
terms of Thompson's approach to rate of growth he thought about this as literal growth where as opposed to sort of   
23:39   
Huxley and then the school alometric school where they think about logarithmic growth and so you have to   
23:44   
normalize growth um and that's how we approach scaling today but Thompson actually approached this from a literal   
23:52   
context and you can tell because he's using grids that he's not using any sort of log transformation. instead he's   
23:58   
using sort of talking about the literal growth of the organism on these grids that then sort of normalize the u the   
24:06   
rate of growth across organisms. So the first thing here is this point is   
24:12   
log scaling uh leads us to this description of differential growth that started with Huxley's work and then kind   
24:18   
of moved on to alometric scaling. But the way another way Thompson thought   
24:24   
about it that was strange at least to the modern eye is that he thought about   
24:29   
growth as being this sort of compound interest. And so you know it's kind of like almost like an economic metaphor   
24:37   
where you you invest in some growth and then you get a return on that investment and you invest in more growth and so on   
24:43   
and so forth. And the way he would describe it say in a bariate context was to have sort of a   
24:49   
first derivative versus a second derivative. So the first derivative would be rate of growth. The second   
24:56   
derivative would be acceleration of growth kind of like the equations of motion and then you could describe   
25:04   
um growth in that way. Another thing he was very interested in   
25:09   
was this concept of homeomorphism which is something that you know the cyberneticists would later use to   
25:16   
describe the mappings between models in the environment or   
25:22   
models in a system. So the idea is that you have this real world in these in   
25:27   
this case a real world of forces acting upon an organism and you have to map that to some representation which is the   
25:34   
organism's shape. And so the organism the shape of the organism describes this homeomorphism.   
25:42   
And if you compare two shapes you can see this homeomorphic map where there's an organism that is basically the same   
25:50   
underneath. it's just described by two sets of forces acting upon it. So the   
25:56   
forces in sort of uh provide this homeomorphic map where everything is   
26:02   
roughly equivalent between the two organisms and the only thing that's different are how forces act upon them   
26:08   
and so you can describe that difference. So thinking a little bit about   
26:13   
Thompson's transformations on these grids, these are cartisian grids. So you   
26:19   
know you know we're used to thinking in terms of fancy geometries and dimensionality reduction when we think   
26:26   
about modern uh machine learning and modern sort of mathematical biology but   
26:32   
in this case he just used cartisian coordinates and maybe that was a brilliant stroke of genius on his part   
26:38   
to simplify things. Maybe it was wolffully inadequate, but I think, you   
26:43   
know, I don't think it matters too much because the principle is the same. He's just   
26:49   
describing these morphologies using a coordinate system and he's one   
26:55   
interested in the transformations and that's the key. Um   
27:01   
so anyways um but the other thing that was unique about his way of thinking   
27:06   
about this is that he thought of the whole organism. He thought about the whole organism   
27:13   
as all everything is being important. So it was a holistic approach instead of a reductionist one. And you know, you   
27:20   
have, of course, different traits as landmarks on the grid, but really all of   
27:25   
those landmarks change sort of relative to one another. So, it's kind of an   
27:31   
interesting point that you're not isolating different traits and you're taking them one at a time. He's just   
27:36   
analyzing the whole thing all in one shot. And so if we go back to this point I was talking about with having a   
27:43   
vocabulary for complexity. This is kind of thinking about how to measure   
27:48   
emergence or emerging phenomena. So all of these traits change together due to   
27:53   
physical forces. Those physical forces then force us to think about the organism not as a collection of traits   
28:00   
but is this emerging phenomena that results from those constraints acting upon the organism. Now, of course, this   
28:07   
doesn't take into account things that are shaped by genetics or shaped by   
28:14   
other things that aren't physical forces, but this is a good, I think, example of where he's basically looking   
28:20   
at emerging phenomena without mentioning it because he didn't have the vocabulary.   
28:27   
So you know the way he's thinking about this is that you have an embryo that is roughly similar in terms of shape from   
28:33   
organism to organism and then through development they acquire these different organismal shapes that are related but   
28:41   
different. And so he thought about you know common ancestry that was part of his mental model. He thought about how   
28:49   
embryos are basically the same which is uh not really true. We know that now. Um   
28:55   
and then of course we had these uh changes across organisms from a sort of   
29:03   
a common ancestry and you know again not worried about the genetics not worried   
29:09   
about other changes. The only thing he's worried about is the morphology.   
29:16   
This is an example of two different morphologies on a grid that's been deformed. So a you have a square grid   
29:24   
with uh this pelvis of stegosaurus and then you have the pelvis of captosaurus   
29:29   
which changes it there's some uh changes in the way that it's uh you know the   
29:35   
shape and then that's represented by changes in this grid in how the different points are aligned and so you   
29:41   
can describe that mathematically pretty easily and then that describes the difference between stegosaurus and   
29:47   
camposaurus. So the last thing I want to talk about   
29:52   
is actually going farther a field from this and talking about Valentino Bradenberg's work on um on this book on   
30:00   
the texture of brains which came out in 1977. So Valentino Bradenberg in the Saturday   
30:06   
morning neurosim group we've been talking about his work in neuroanatomy his work on you know thinking about   
30:15   
uh anatomical structures and then linking that to sort of these artificial   
30:21   
brains artificial simulations. And so he had this chapter on the texture of brains called physics and   
30:27   
anti-ysics. And so physics and anti-ysics   
30:33   
basically is about setting this uh vocabulary agenda for neuroscience in   
30:40   
particular but also for bi sort of a biology specific um vocabulary for   
30:47   
talking about things like emergent phenomena and other types of uh   
30:52   
capturing phenomena in say like things like contos. So um a couple words here. He views   
31:01   
causal explanations as sort of the difference between sort of this reductionist view where we look   
31:09   
at the level of particles. They could be molecules. They could be atoms. So you take a very atomistic view of causality.   
31:16   
You're looking at the interactions between particles or the cause causal relationships between particles   
31:23   
as opposed to things where you have emerging phenomena where you have to   
31:28   
describe things as in their whole to get a proper representation of their causal   
31:34   
context. And he calls these explanations out of context.   
31:39   
So the context of these particular causal mechanisms will give you one   
31:45   
answer and then looking at the whole system which is the product of a emergent phenomena looking at causality   
31:53   
at that level will give you another answer. And so this is very much in line with the way we view emergence today   
32:00   
that emergence is fundamentally different from the atomistic productionist view.   
32:06   
uh some words about information. So in he's interested in the brain and he's   
32:12   
interested in how you have these units of information or these units of   
32:17   
interaction in the brain and you can use all sorts of different units of   
32:23   
explanation for how things happen in the brain. Um, as it turns out, the brain   
32:29   
consists of a few types of cells and they usually are found together and we can use these motifs uh to to get there.   
32:38   
So, we have these clusters of neurons where you have like a neuron or a pair   
32:43   
of neurons, some GA and some astrot surrounding them. And that's one of these units of information.   
32:50   
And if you look at that an neuroanatomically again at the anatomical level you can   
32:56   
treat those units as motifs much like we treat words or codons as motifs or you   
33:05   
know maybe the common parlance as tokens in a model. So you know in uh the   
33:11   
analysis of DNA we'll use codons to understand what DNA does. It turns it,   
33:17   
you know, it gets transformed into um   
33:24   
it gets transformed into amino acids and then into proteins. Or you might have   
33:30   
words or sometimes people will use the term engrams to describe u you know   
33:36   
things that will lead to a vocabulary, things that will lead to sentences and texts and things like that. So this is   
33:42   
all kind of you know a a means of taking the whole breaking it down and then   
33:48   
bridging that gap between sort of the emerging phenomena that we observe as   
33:53   
the whole sort of organism or the whole brain and then these particular atomistic descriptions.   
34:02   
And so then you know these neuronal cell processes consisting of a couple of neurons some glyas some aststerytes   
34:08   
these are geometric relations or networks between neuronal cell   
34:13   
processes. So what I think uh Bradenberg is describing here is sort of like this simple approach to networks that we have   
34:22   
today where you have different motifs in the network. You have these first so you   
34:27   
have these motifs as the nodes which are you know these uh sets of neurons ga and   
34:32   
aststerytes which form a you know a fundamental unit of function that allows   
34:38   
you to process information but then you have these connections between them and those connections form sort of geometric   
34:45   
relations. They're both geometric in terms of their anatomical   
34:50   
uh relative anatomical location and they're geometrical. So in terms of the network where you can draw these shapes   
34:57   
in the network, you can draw polygons, you can draw other types of shapes and they are all sort of descriptive of the   
35:05   
of the topology of the network. So it describes sort of how these normal cell   
35:10   
processes are related not just in terms of their how many connections they have   
35:15   
but also in terms of their physical collocation or their orientation one   
35:21   
another. And so this is where causal explanations of different types converge. So this is   
35:28   
where we can get a sense of these two different levels of explanation and bring them together conceptually. Um,   
35:36   
now it doesn't necessarily help that Bretonberg didn't have the language for   
35:41   
describing, you know, we don't really have a good language for biological emergence, but we could probably do that   
35:48   
and be better off here. We could get a better account. So, you know, what I've presented here are all these ideas,   
35:55   
these precursors to modern complexity theory and biological complexity. And so   
36:00   
I, you know, I hope this gives people food for thought in terms of how to approach this stuff and maybe some of   
36:06   
our um uh historical anticedants that maybe will you know give them a better   
36:13   
sense of how to think about these problems.   
36:18   
All right. So this is uh I worked up this set of images uh based on our discussion about the problem of relative   
36:26   
growth versus the problem of absolute growth. So the problem of relative growth goes back to Huxley and we use   
36:31   
this often in alometry studies and this is where we measure one trait versus   
36:37   
another trait. So we might measure head length with respect to body length if we're looking at a fish which we'll see   
36:42   
in a minute can be represented in other ways. So we have this proportion of the   
36:48   
head length and the body length. And you can see this in this you can see this in this bar graph here   
36:56   
where we take the head length and the body length of many different species or many different specimens. We plot them   
37:02   
out on this plot and we get some sort of function that describes it. And a lot of times this function is logarithmic. I   
37:09   
put a linear function here. Um but it's a lot of times it's logarithmic. So you   
37:14   
know you have like at the beginning you have the linear phase and then you have the logarithmic phase coming off at the   
37:21   
end where the growth essentially of the head saturates relative to the body. So this is relative growth and the idea   
37:28   
behind this maps very neatly onto the notion of something like hawk genes or   
37:33   
something like where you know you have different proportions of different body   
37:39   
sizes that are selected for an evolution. So this is relative growth. But what uh   
37:47   
Darcy Thompson was talking about was absolute growth or the problem of absolute growth. And the problem of absolute growth isn't about different   
37:53   
body proportions. It's about describing the geometry of the organism. So here   
37:59   
you can see that you have a fish and you have these different axes upon which you're measuring. You can measure this   
38:05   
in different ways. Basically you're trying to extract shape parameters from this object. Now he uses a grid but   
38:13   
that's you know that's um for a premputational era. In the computational   
38:19   
era we can actually describe shapes like this using a number of methods. So we can use of course polomials   
38:26   
and the famous dictim by vonman that if you give me five uh parameters I can   
38:32   
draw you an elephant and with the sixth parameter I can have it wiggle its uh trunk. meaning that you can achieve any   
38:39   
shape if you have enough parameters and of course in that case you can fit a   
38:45   
curve to the shape of an elephant and you can have uh motion of the trunk and all that and in a relatively small   
38:51   
number of parameters. So as long as we have these shape parameters as well as they're well characterized, we don't   
38:57   
need that much in terms of parameters uh or parameterization to achieve a   
39:04   
description of the shape. And then of course it's absolute growth in terms of the organism. But if we were to compare   
39:11   
this with another species, we would also have this sim similar set of shape parameters and we could find sort of the   
39:18   
things that distinguish those two species which is useful information especially   
39:23   
if you're building a fogyny based on uh fo or phenotypic character traits   
39:30   
and so we can use a number so we can use polomials we can use a cartisian coordinate system like Darcy Thompson   
39:36   
did we can use other coordinate systems depending on the the shape of the morphology and then we can use conformal   
39:44   
maps. Conformal maps are interesting because they allow you to warp the   
39:50   
morphology and and explore some of these shape parameters in more detail. You're basically building this homeomorphism   
39:57   
between the absolute shape of the organism and some sort of conformal map   
40:03   
that might describe an entire cate. then you just simply find the the shape   
40:09   
parameter values for your specific species on that conformal map. So this   
40:14   
you know there are different methods that we can use methods that were you know kind of developed well past the   
40:20   
time of Darcy Thompson. Okay. So that's a problem of absolute growth. Now this is a graph where this is stating Darcy   
40:28   
Thompson's uh vision of absolute growth where we have the rate of growth versus   
40:33   
acceleration of growth. And of course this is sort of the first order versus the second order. So again he's using   
40:39   
growth as an absolute measure of sort of shape or geometry. And then he's   
40:45   
treating this comparison as sort of like the equations of motion where you have the first derivative of position which   
40:52   
is position and then you have the second derivative of position which is which could be velocity and then of course you   
41:00   
can have acceleration. And you can have a higher orders acceleration and so forth. So this is rate versus   
41:06   
acceleration thought of as first order and versus second order. And you can see it's very different from this graph   
41:11   
because this graph is is described either by some linear function or more likely a logarithmic function where   
41:17   
there's a saturation of head length versus body length. So you can't have a head length that's the equivalent of the   
41:24   
total body length. That would be ridiculous. the head length is saturated somewhere where the rest of the body   
41:30   
because remember the rest of the body is also growing relative or changing relative to body length and you have   
41:35   
this sort of share of the body that the head takes up and at some point it becomes too big to support by the rest   
41:42   
of the body. Now in the case of absolute growth however we're not worried about that we're worried about the rate of   
41:48   
growth overall. So you measure this organism, you measure its physical   
41:54   
parameters, and if they're growing or if they're positive, then that's where we're a rate of growth. And we can calculate that over time. If we have a   
42:01   
developmental system that's growing in size over time. So we can characterize a   
42:06   
rate of growth, which is actually kind of a velocity of of growth, if you will, because it's how fast, you know, how   
42:14   
what is the change in growth over time. This is almost a time series but but   
42:19   
it's just rate so it's fine. And then acceleration of growth is sort of the second order of that which means how   
42:26   
does the rate of growth change. So you end up with a very different you almost end up with a time series with a   
42:32   
trace where you can look at these peaks and say that at this you know at this rate you have this acceleration versus   
42:40   
the rate and you can you know know kind of you can you can do you know   
42:45   
differential calculus on it. you can uh explore it using gradients, things like that. So we could actually do a lot of   
42:52   
interesting mathematics with absolute growth that we can't do with relative growth or at least directly with   
42:58   
relative growth. So that's interesting. Um and people   
43:03   
haven't really explored absolute growth as much as they maybe could. Um an interesting area.   
43:11   
So this is uh hyperorphosis. This is where we have relative growth. But we   
43:17   
also can characterize acceleration which we're characterizing as the second order here. So instead of being peaks in a   
43:24   
time series, this is a shift in the function describing this relative growth   
43:30   
problem. So here we have body length and head length as we do up in this graph.   
43:36   
And we have our species here that form these trend lines, these linear trend lines.   
43:42   
And there's a difference here. So that this trend line over time will increase.   
43:47   
So it means that every time you look at a certain body length and if you look at the difference between these two   
43:53   
functions, the head length is longer. So head length description for a given body   
44:00   
length value is longer in this second function. And what does that mean? Well,   
44:05   
that means that there's an acceleration of growth happening in the head because   
44:11   
as the body's expanding, the head's expanding faster. And so you can track this across this entire range of values.   
44:20   
Any body length, you get a corresponding head length that's larger. And that means the head   
44:26   
length is growing faster than body length. So a head length will take up a larger proportion of the body at you   
44:33   
know in in adulthood when growth has stopped. And so hypermorphosis though des this is   
44:41   
just a different description of u this acceleration growth that Thompson   
44:49   
talked about in terms of absolute growth and it's a little bit even more targeted   
44:54   
because you have this relative growth. We know what the biological underpinnings of that are. They're not   
45:00   
as vague as like absolute growth. I mean, if I described a shape of an organism, that doesn't mean anything   
45:06   
necessarily. There are a lot of mechanisms that are interacting. But if I describe a relative growth problem, I   
45:11   
can say this acceleration of growth is caused by X or Y. Could be a gene   
45:16   
circuit. It could be a gene itself, just a single gene. It could be uh you know   
45:22   
all sorts of different uh   
45:29   
you know it could be something that you can target and maybe knock out or knock down in the genome and then look at how   
45:36   
it affects the acceleration of growth and you know you can see that it might affect the acceleration growth quite   
45:42   
greatly. It might increase it might decrease it. So it gives you greater control. Nevertheless, this absolute   
45:49   
growth is very interesting because it is sort of a way to look at growth is sort   
45:55   
of almost like this fractal process where there's a growth in the entire organism. we can see the emergent   
46:02   
features of like the genome and environment but you know so there are all these uh   
46:09   
gene gene and gene environment interactions going on here that represent the shape   
46:16   
but then you know you can also say okay there's an acceleration growth here at this point in development at this point   
46:22   
in development why and it could be because of some phase in development it could be because there certain   
46:27   
environmental factors it could be that there genes that are interacting at some point.   
46:33   
So it's just a different way to characterize it. But there I just wanted to point out there important differences   
46:38   
between the two. Okay. Now there's this paper I found from in nature methods. It   
46:44   
kind of ties this together in terms of embryo models. So this is mapping morphogenesis and mechanics and embryo   
46:51   
models. And this is from a group that is interested in physical forces, embryos,   
47:00   
and they even get into organoids and things like that. So they're actually interested in cell differentiation and   
47:07   
these multisellular structures that are differentiating and have some shape that   
47:13   
we can describe, but also is due to geometry and forces. So you could say that they're kind of picking up the   
47:19   
Darcy Thompson legacy but also doing that casting that in a modern way. So the abstract recent methodological   
47:26   
advances in measurements of geometry and forces and the early embryo and its models are enabling a deeper   
47:32   
understanding of the complex interplay of genetics, mechanics and geometry during development. They actually talk   
47:38   
about flows and forces. So orphagenesis can be described very   
47:43   
generally by tissue flow that is the local rate of displacement. So this is due to growth or due to cell migration.   
47:50   
Usually if you have more cells you have more flow you have more displacement but   
47:55   
not always. Tissue flow can be obtained from imaging data directly at the pixel level using   
48:01   
particle image veloisometry or optical flow. In a first application of such techniques to embryo models, optical   
48:08   
flow is used to demonstrate that the endodermal cap forms by collective cell migration in 3D gastroids.   
48:14   
I'm going to show you this in this figure one. Alternatively, tissue flow can be obtained by cell tracking which   
48:20   
provides more information about cellular level movements that underly the overall tissue change shape. So these changes in   
48:27   
shape, these rates of change are um sort of affected by cellular level movements,   
48:35   
migration things we can track and figure out the time course of. They map to   
48:40   
differentiation events in the embryo and you can slow them down or speed them up   
48:45   
based on cell doubling time and uh other types of you know things like you know   
48:53   
how you know cells adhere to each other, how they form sheets, how they can sense   
48:59   
their positional information etc. Recent improvements to cell tracking   
49:05   
include machine learning approaches that improve segmentation and efficiently handle very large data sets by   
49:11   
automatically discriminating spatiotemporal features of cell lineages and cell division events. So this is   
49:18   
where we have the spatiotemporal aspect of cellages and division events. We know kind of when cells are dividing, what   
49:25   
lineage or sublineage they're in, and how that affects where they're located in the embryo. And then that gives us   
49:31   
some idea of how shape the sort of the precursors of shape. These methods were shown to be very effective at analyzing   
49:38   
mouse gastrolation and can be anticipated to soon find application in studying embryo models.   
49:45   
So this is uh their work in 3D gastroloid. And so they're showing some cartoons and   
49:52   
they're showing some microscopy images. So we'll start at A.   
49:58   
So A is a schematic of a 3D gastrloid. It has this bean shape and it has a red end here which is the endodermal cap   
50:05   
which they mentioned before. So gastroloid is not an embryo but it's like this collection of cells. It's kind   
50:11   
of takes on different shapes um primordial shapes mainly but they're   
50:16   
they're supposed to be differentiating cells are trying to behave collectively   
50:22   
and do something functionally interesting. Uh B is where we have tissue flow in a   
50:28   
3D gastrloid expressing brachiuri reporter which is dark uh and then you   
50:34   
know the other cells which aren't. So you have these uh cells in the gastrloid they're expressing like these   
50:41   
developmental markers and some that are not.   
50:46   
So they're kind of being primed for differentiation or primed for a specific developmental stage.   
50:53   
uh C is the fusion of mouse embriionic stem cell aggregates. The equation in C   
51:00   
defines the expected time evolution and can be   
51:06   
fitted to obtain the towel and beta parameters which are proportional to ratios of sheer viscosity and sheer   
51:12   
modulus. So this is where we have this uh fusion of embryionic cells. We have   
51:19   
this measurement of their time evolution in terms of how they're fusing together.   
51:25   
And then you have these different parameters that relate to physical   
51:31   
properties such as sheer viscosity and sheer modulus respectively to surface   
51:36   
tension. So this is not the same thing that Thompson was arguing which is to measure the phenotype and look at how it   
51:44   
gets warped by the the grid. This is where we're using physical uh parameters   
51:51   
and we're describing the shape changes in the uh the whatever it is this this   
51:57   
self fusion in this case and then we're describing the forces that act upon it.   
52:02   
So we're not describing it just purely in terms of a coordinate system. We're using like sheer modulus and we can   
52:08   
measure those with newer technologies. So this is why they're doing this and it's actually a lot more informative and   
52:15   
allows for a lot more prediction than just simply looking at differences in shape. D is the schematic of the ETX   
52:23   
embryoid. So this is uh something they mentioned in the paper. This is another type of u organoid.   
52:31   
E is the tissue cgraphy which is um using msane which is image surface   
52:38   
analysis environment. So instead of insane it's insane and it's capital and small letters based on the the acronym.   
52:47   
So this is done for the inner epithelium consisting of epiblast and extra embriionic.   
52:54   
So this is E where you see the the the shape the extracted 3D projection.   
53:00   
In F you have mechanical equilibrium where interfacial tension is T and cellular pressurees P. And an epithelium   
53:07   
can be inferred from the vertex angles and membrane curvature radius. So you   
53:13   
can see this unrolling process where you can look at the shape of the cells and infer the forces. So it's not just about   
53:21   
putting them on a a grid where it's deformed. You actually can infer the forces from that because the forces   
53:27   
operate by physical laws and they're predictable. And then of course this unrolled 2D   
53:33   
projection using MSAN and it just basically you have to use of course cell   
53:38   
segmentation very good cell segmentation algorithms and then have this account of   
53:43   
what the effect of different strains are on a cell's morphology. So if it's being squeezed or pulled apart or whatever. Uh   
53:52   
G is actually F is mechanical equilibrium interfacial tensions T and C. This is where we have this cartoon   
53:59   
again where we show at a tri junction this time where these interfacial tensions and cellular pressures kind of   
54:07   
play a role. So you look at this image and you see these deformationations and here we have a mechanical model where   
54:13   
the deformations are translated into parameter values at the cellular level. And we know kind of what these are. We   
54:20   
can measure these empirically. We can also use imaging uh methods like this to   
54:27   
sort of understand how these things change uh and and we can model it this way.   
54:36   
G is the inferred membrane tensions from cell geometry in Drosophila lateral ectoderm. So showing an example in   
54:41   
Drosophila instead of an organoid. H is the schematic of a 2D asteroid. So   
54:47   
another cartoon. And then the map traction stresses in I of a 2D   
54:52   
gastroloid. So we have the cartoon of a gastrloid here. And then this is this is the idealized one in H. And then this I   
54:59   
is where we have the traction stresses and Pascals. And we're measuring it. The colors are lighter is higher, darker is   
55:07   
lower. And so one another point they make is that you know you don't start off with   
55:13   
the adult phenotype. So one thing that we didn't see in the examples from Darcy   
55:19   
Thompson was that you know you have an embryo and you have a a mature phenotype   
55:24   
and you can't really compare the two because there are a lot of intermediate stages and with embryos you can see this   
55:31   
because in embryoids you're growing them denovo you're growing them from uh cells   
55:37   
that are dissociated and then they just grow in in in a culture and so they form   
55:43   
these aggregates. it's um independent of like say an embryo. Uh and then you know   
55:50   
they form these these shapes and these structures that have function. And so in   
55:56   
early embryoids we can look at maybe some of the things that aren't constrained by embryos or aren't constrained by the sort of linear view   
56:04   
of development as moving from like kind of a common embryo to differences. We   
56:09   
have all these different dynamics that play a role in what it ends up looking like. We also have buffering which makes   
56:17   
maintains sort of a homeostasis and development. But um basically you know   
56:23   
the embryoids I think are a window into what development could do. And so   
56:31   
anyways uh so before forming large epithelial structures embryo models typically combine small numbers of   
56:37   
embryionic and extra embryionic cells in suspension. So this is where we're using   
56:43   
embryoids to build this embryo model. We have these dissociated cells in suspension. We have small numbers of   
56:50   
cells and then they they double in place and they migrate in place and they form these patterns. The initial dynamics of   
56:58   
these cells as they rearrange into organized structures is of great interest. Understanding this benefits   
57:03   
from analysis of individual cell shapes and interfaces in three dimensions with   
57:09   
high accuracy in single cell measurements of mechanical properties. So again we we want to take this broad   
57:16   
emergent view but we can't do that just in one shot. We need to kind of go down   
57:22   
a couple of levels and build models of individual cells interacting with other cells and then understand those kind of   
57:29   
interactions as contributing to these larger aggregates and then eventually to   
57:34   
the larger phenotype. Recent advances are made for subcellular   
57:40   
segmentation of small embryos including early mouse and aidian embryos with the goal more accurate inference of   
57:47   
mechanics. Delaney watershed was designed to avoid introducing biases. So they use a Delaney watershed uh   
57:54   
segmentation technique which you know depending on the what you're trying to learn uh from the data. If you're   
58:02   
looking at say a lot of angles you want to and and a lot of the effects of forces you want to have an algorithm   
58:08   
that allows you to do that. Watershed apparently or the Delani U algorithm is   
58:14   
good for that. A different approach generalizes a 2D approach for enforcing consistency of the segmentation with   
58:21   
mechanical equilibrium to 3D. Uh then this is this 35. Uh they don't   
58:28   
they just say it's a preprint. Uh this is by La Mer. So this is in um   
58:34   
Acidians. This is the mechanical atlas for acidian   
58:40   
gastrolation. So they've done this in looked at mechanical stresses in acidians and built a a mechanical stress   
58:47   
map and you know this is all sort of insight to this isn't like a organoid   
58:54   
where they're doing this. Um both methods then can be used in   
59:00   
previous 3D force in inference to verify predictions. Tension of and adhesion   
59:05   
between individual cells can be measured directly with micro pipet aspiration.   
59:11   
This was previously done for the mouse blast and recently applied to measure the differential adhesion between cell   
59:17   
types in ETX embryoids. So this is just kind of thinking and then of course we can talk about   
59:22   
patterning and morphogenesis where we haven't studied tissue patterning and morphagenesis in the same   
59:29   
system but now with these embryo models these embryoids we can do that and so we   
59:36   
can relate mechanics to tissue geometry and that gives us sort of this full   
59:41   
account of the Thompsonian view of these   
59:46   
organisms in total.
