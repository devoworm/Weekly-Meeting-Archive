## TRANSCRIPT     
0:02   
Hello. Right. So, welcome to today's meeting. Um, we're going to talk about a number   
0:09   
of things. I wanted to highlight some uh uh media on YouTube and things like   
0:15   
that. And then I wanted to talk about a paper um on C elegance that just came out. So   
0:23   
the first thing is uh congratulations uh to Varsith   
0:28   
uh and Varsith made a pull request to the D.VLearn   
0:34   
repository. So this is number 40 add hypers sage and unis comms improve   
0:41   
config and edge handling. So this was merged by Leith. Um and so   
0:47   
congratulations to Vettith for making that contribution. Uh he puts in the comments here   
0:54   
introduces Hypers Sage Con and Unice Con. These are convolutional layers for   
1:00   
hyperraph convolution. Updates config to autogenerated embedded paths   
1:06   
and support new comps recurrent neural network types and   
1:12   
improves hyperedge construction by using precomputed birth times or live cell   
1:17   
filtering. Updates argument parsing and embedding saving logic to reflect new   
1:23   
config behavior. refactors model to support new convolution in RNN cell   
1:28   
types and updates snapshot construction to past birth times. So this is on um   
1:34   
the work that I think I guess that Leith had done over the summer and this is   
1:40   
just uh issuing a poll request to make some of these updates to those tools.   
1:47   
And so uh Leith says overall good work need some minor adjustments once they're cleared we're ready to merge to the main   
1:54   
So that's what's going on there. Uh again, this is in the DVOLERN   
2:00   
uh organization. This is the DVO graph repository. I also wanted to point out that AIFIE   
2:07   
2025 is now on YouTube. So ALife 2025 conference which was uh this fall uh and   
2:16   
this is the website. Uh they put up their videos. So they recorded their videos. Now they're ready to view. So   
2:23   
there are a number of sessions uh there's evolution one two and three here   
2:28   
the keynotes u so you know there Hector Zenil was one of the keynotes I think   
2:35   
Michael Leven was one of the other keynotes and then of course they had a robotic session and they had these   
2:42   
panels where they had different conversations this is the anti-ytherra conversation   
2:47   
anti-yther is an ancient Greek computer that uh people talk about a lot as being   
2:53   
one of the first computers that humans created. Of course, those   
2:58   
are all ancient computers and they did things like uh calculate numbers and   
3:05   
manipulate symbols. And of course, this is far removed from the computers we have today, but it's still worth   
3:10   
thinking about um in the context of modern computing, especially fields like   
3:16   
a life where you're trying to understand the origins   
3:21   
and evolution of life. So check that out on YouTube. Awife 2025   
3:28   
is the channel. All right. Now, this is the paper here I want to talk about. This is uh from PNAS. Uh this has a   
3:36   
number of different authors on it. Um this is uh Victor Ambrose, Smarty Chelie,   
3:42   
uh Gary Rufkin, Nathan Schroeder, Paul Sternberg. These are uh and what they're   
3:49   
trying to do here is they're trying to understand or they're trying to give us   
3:54   
this path from the origins of C elegance as a model organism to the Nobel Prize   
4:02   
that was rewarded that was awarded last year on uh to Ambrose and Chelie for   
4:11   
their work in C elegance. So sea elegance originated as a model organism   
4:17   
in the 1960s. Sydney Brener proposed that we could use sea elegance to   
4:24   
uh sort of model a lot of things in biology that we hadn't been able to previously.   
4:30   
There are a number of properties of sea elegance that enabled all these types of investigations.   
4:35   
everything from highly tractable genetics, very small conneto and a very short   
4:43   
generation time. So we can do a lot of things with sea elegans that we couldn't say do with humans or even other model   
4:50   
organisms like mouse or even fruit flies. And so sea elegance became a   
4:56   
predominant uh model organism. It went from like the lab of Sydney Brener and   
5:03   
then you know people at Oxford who started working on it became famous to a   
5:09   
model organism where you know there's a community of several thousand people and   
5:14   
the you know the worm conference of course is the manifestation of that work where you have many it's a very large   
5:21   
conference uh where you have all of the people using you know working with C elegance very different uh context some   
5:28   
people are geneticists Some people were interested in the conneto, some people were cell biologists, some people were   
5:34   
evolutionary biologists uh and so forth. Some people were medical uh scientists and they're all   
5:40   
interested in using sea elegance because it's easy to culture because it has all these different life history and   
5:48   
physiological traits that make it attractive to being a model organism.   
5:54   
And so this is basically uh an overview of that history. And then of course a   
6:00   
lot of the community tools that have enabled the growth of sea elegance as a   
6:06   
model organism. So one of the things you find in the sea elegance community are these great curated resources.   
6:14   
Um you know things where you have data repositories and you have libraries of mutations   
6:22   
defined mutations. You have libraries of, you know, strains of worm that you   
6:28   
can order and bring into your lab and start culturing them immediately. You have knowledge bases where you can find   
6:35   
out information about any aspect of C. Elegant's biology that you'd like. Uh,   
6:42   
worm book is one example of that. So, you have all these different and then you have atlases where you can look up   
6:48   
parts of the anatomy and you can look at how they register gene expression and all that.   
6:54   
So there's a lot of interesting stuff that you can do with C elegance, a lot of useful things. It's a very uh   
7:01   
wellorganized community and u so they kind of walk through   
7:07   
a lot of this work and of course it's a lot of it supported by the NIH and so   
7:14   
this is tied in very tightly with medical research. So a lot of you know   
7:21   
disorders that we have in humans we can actually look at the uh homologues and   
7:27   
paralogues of genes in sea elegance and we can understand the genetic bases of   
7:32   
these diseases in sea elegance. We can do experiments in sea elegance we couldn't do in humans and we can figure   
7:39   
out maybe some of the signaling pathways involved in these disorders. So it's a very useful tool.   
7:47   
So let's go through the abstract.   
7:55   
So the abstract reads, experimental organisms such as the nematode segans or caner heepditis elegance are fundamental   
8:03   
to biological discovery. So we have all sorts of model organisms out there. Uh we you know sometimes we have model   
8:10   
organisms for specific modes of biology like developmental biology. So we have   
8:16   
zebra fish and we use zebra fish for developmental biology. We use other types of organisms for developmental   
8:22   
biology as well like xenopus. We also use sea elegans for developmental   
8:27   
biology but not exclusively. We use fruit flies for looking at genetics. We also use sea elegance. And   
8:34   
so if we go across their model organisms sometimes they're very specialized in terms of what they're used for.   
8:40   
Sometimes they serve as a sort of workh horses. So like sea elegance is similar to mice or to yeast in that it's this   
8:48   
workhorse where it's just doing all sorts you can do all sorts of experiments with it and really get down   
8:53   
to pathways molecular pathways that can give you information   
9:00   
about a wide host of biological processes. Uh so   
9:08   
the success of C elegance research has been greatly enabled by infrastructure that allows thousands of scientists to   
9:14   
share and access research materials and unpublished information efficiently.   
9:19   
Here we celebrate the worm by interweaving vignettes describing four Nobel prizewinning discoveries with   
9:27   
descriptions of how the major NIH support research support resources   
9:34   
with descriptions of how the major NIH supported research resources   
9:39   
and those uh four are virtually and those three are the Canerptitis   
9:46   
genetic center worm base and worm atlas. provide invaluable support for all C   
9:52   
elegance research. The synergy between investigation and the availability of   
9:58   
shared resources for the C elegance community is a paradigm for all model organism research and the continued   
10:05   
support of such community research resources will be essential for maximizing impactful discoveries in the   
10:11   
future. Very good. So   
10:16   
really, you know, when we think about our knowledge of human biology, we think of studying humans. We think of medical   
10:24   
imaging. We think of things like cadaavver studies. We think of things like direct   
10:31   
assays. And that's that's all useful, but sometimes we need to understand   
10:36   
processes that we can't directly observe or it's very hard to directly observe.   
10:42   
And so this is where of course our animal models come into play and they're   
10:47   
very important parts of the biomedical enterprise. I know people are trying to   
10:53   
sort of get around that with cell models, but I doubt that cell models are   
10:58   
really going to give us the kinds of insights that animal models will. And so   
11:05   
animal models provide unparalleled experimental access to fundamental biological processes that are shared   
11:11   
across evolution, including with humans. The logic is simple but profound. If a   
11:17   
mechanism is ancient and conserved, then uncovering it in other organisms provides insights into our own biology.   
11:24   
So this is an important point is that we can use the power of common ancestry to   
11:31   
understand a lot of these processes at a very fundamental level. So of course humans and nematodeses are they share a   
11:38   
common ancestor. Those common that common ancestor had genetic pathways   
11:45   
that diversified in both in both lineages but have commonalities in terms   
11:51   
of their structure in terms of signaling that is insightful that can tell us   
11:57   
something about like if we knock down some gene in C elegance we can see an   
12:02   
experimental outcome. we can try and and we have the tools now to find uh   
12:09   
corresponding pathways and genes in humans and then you know do that sort of   
12:16   
you know maybe create drugs or some sort of intervention to help in human health   
12:22   
and so it provides great insights and of course you know in aging that's a famous system in C elegance uh metabolism and   
12:30   
other types of processes that are very general are, you know, those are very we've had   
12:36   
some pretty pretty uh impressive results from that.   
12:50   
This has proven true time and again. Discoveries in yeast, flies, worms, and   
12:55   
mice have eliminated the foundations of human development, physiology, and   
13:00   
disease. Best established models share certain features including the ease of cultivation, a rapid life cycle,   
13:08   
relative simplicity and accessibility to genetic and genomic analysis and   
13:13   
manipulation. These features facilitate both basic research and exploration of potential   
13:18   
translational applications in a controlled and costeffective way. Free of many of the ethical concerns that   
13:25   
apply to any research using humans and human tissues. that these organisms are   
13:30   
not simply substitutes or models used to study known human biology. Often, as   
13:35   
outlined below, they are the source of new discoveries that illuminate unforeseen aspects of human biology. So,   
13:42   
this is just kind of getting into how there's this, you know, this rationale for using C   
13:50   
elegance as a model organism. But of course, just having a model organism is not enough. Just because you   
13:57   
can culture it and you can do experiments in it, that's fine. But you also need a support structure in that   
14:02   
community that emerges to really make a model organism   
14:08   
effective. And so um in this section they go through a brief history of C   
14:14   
elegance as a model organism and the worm community in quotes because the worm community is very important to have   
14:21   
people who can share data who can share insights to have a nice uh conduit into   
14:29   
the community. So when you start working with C elegance you have those resources that help you along. Uh there are a lot   
14:37   
of you know people who maybe start working with a model organism and they'll try culture again. I think this   
14:43   
is true of a lot of datom people where you know they start working with datoms   
14:48   
and they're able to isolated and and grow it in culture but then it's very tricky to maintain the cultures. There's   
14:55   
all sorts of you know knowledge that isn't like immediately available and it's very frustrating to get your uh   
15:03   
some some actual quality work established in in a in a setting like that. So in C in the sea elegance   
15:10   
community you benefit from a lot of communal knowledge and having that at your fingertips.   
15:18   
So the use of C elegance to dissect biological truths originated in the visionary thinking of Sydney Brener.   
15:24   
After an extraordinary career defining fundamental principles of molecular biology. By the early 1960s, Brener was   
15:32   
searching for a relatively simple animal where these principles could be applied to understand mechanisms controlling   
15:38   
development and nervous system function. We just see elegance for its simpler anatomy development and more rapid life   
15:46   
cycle than the wellestablished model organism drosophila melanagaster. So Drosophila the fruitfly is you know was   
15:54   
a model organism uh well from well before when sea elegance was established. uh a lot of the early   
16:01   
genetics experiments were done in fruitfly and you know there all sorts of   
16:06   
again uh advantages of using grapha as a model   
16:12   
but of course it's more complex the development is longer and the life cycle   
16:19   
was longer than sea elegance so there's an advantage to choosing sea elegance   
16:25   
over drosophila of course drosophila had you know well character ized genome for   
16:30   
the time. So that was another advantage. So C elegance had a lot of innate advantages, but it had to overcome some   
16:38   
barriers to really kind of getting a quality experiment. While considered by some to be an odd   
16:44   
career move at the time, Rener's decision propelled a little known roundorm to the juggernaut of biomedical   
16:50   
research. And then there's a figure one. We'll see that in a minute. Since Brener's seinal   
16:56   
publication establishing the worm as a genetic system, research into sea elegance is burned continuously and now   
17:03   
includes fundamental discovery in myriad areas, including landmark discoveries recognized by four Nobel prizes. So   
17:09   
there have been four Nobel prizes given uh for different topics in medicine and physiology that have involved segance in   
17:17   
some way. So it's become very indispensable for discovering things, unlocking knowledge and and so forth.   
17:26   
Runner's use of the sea elegance attracted many researchers, several of whom established projects that produced   
17:32   
an unprecedented look at an entire multisellular organism mapping the   
17:37   
entire lineage from a single cell to the adult stage describing the cellular wiring diagram which you know this is   
17:44   
the conto all visible chemical gap junctions for the entire 302 neuron nervous system and   
17:53   
developing a genetic and physical map of the genome as a prelude to generating the first complete DNA sequence of an   
17:59   
animal and this is of course the C elegance genome. So for those uh those references   
18:07   
that we just talked about three, four and five, three of course is the embryionic cell lineage of the nematode   
18:14   
segans. This of course was John Solston's work with John White. Uh this   
18:19   
is was published in developmental biology. Then we had of course John White and Sydney Brunner on this paper   
18:26   
the structure of the nervous system of the nematodes elegance. So the first one reference three talked about the uh   
18:34   
lineage tree in development. Number four talked about the 302 neuron conneto   
18:41   
and then number five is uh from the se elegant sequencing consortium and of   
18:47   
course that's genome sequence of the neatode segans a platform for investigating biology and that was   
18:54   
published in science in the year 1998. So a few years before the draft human   
18:59   
genome came out we had a draft sequence of sea elegance and of course that's   
19:05   
been useful in uh you know understanding the the fine mutations that we have   
19:12   
available to us in se elegance and mapping that to a genome and then finding uh paralogues and homalologues   
19:20   
in the human genome. Of course the worms genome is compact. doesn't have as many   
19:26   
chromosomes as the human genome, but it encodes basically the same type of regulatory   
19:33   
machinery that you find in humans. So, it's it's as complex as the human genome   
19:38   
in terms of regulation.   
19:46   
So it has a comparable level of complexity in terms of regulatory mechanisms that the human genome has,   
19:52   
but it's far small and found in far fewer chromosomes.   
19:58   
The development of common resources and the belief that research findings and mutant strains should be freely shared   
20:04   
has propelled worm research to the forefront. This is a great part about like the sea elegance community but also   
20:10   
you see this in the Drosophila community as well where you have this access to   
20:16   
different mutant strains. So you know there there's been a lot of work on   
20:22   
creating the fine mutants which involves a lot of work on isolating   
20:27   
the expression of certain mutant alals and then backcrossing those lines to   
20:33   
make sure that there's total penetrance across the entire line in terms of that alil and then being able to raise   
20:42   
mutants that all have that all share that mutation. And sometimes those mutations oftentimes those mutations   
20:49   
have functional consequences. So a lot of times you know you have mutations that are deficits in metabolism or   
20:58   
sometimes enhanced metabolism, you have deficits in egg laying, you have deficits in other types of areas. Uh you   
21:06   
have accelerated aging or aging and then of course you have uh mutations   
21:12   
that enable sort of raring at different temperatures. So you have all sorts of different functional consequences of   
21:19   
these defined mutants of these defined mutations. But the great thing about it is that you can share those lines with   
21:26   
other researchers. So there are these banks where they freeze down uh certain strains of worm and then you know when   
21:33   
someone wants to do an experiment with the defined mutant they can just simply go to that bank take out a strain and   
21:41   
grow it to you know grow it according to protocols that are also shared and it   
21:47   
provides you with a very easy experimental test bed. You don't have to do all that work yourself and it speeds   
21:53   
up science. This community spirit was alive early on with Bob Bedker's establishment in 1975 of the Wormreeders   
22:00   
Gazette, a newsletter for sharing information prior to publication. So, this is a   
22:06   
a nice resource where you can get all sorts of informal information about how   
22:12   
to, you know, do cell culture and how to maintain your your lines and your   
22:18   
strains in a way that's, you know, uh, standardized across labs. And you know   
22:24   
it's very cell culture is very hard to do uh correctly or in this case worm culture. Uh there are a lot of things   
22:31   
that are sort of qualitative a lot of tricks that you have to follow and sometimes you know you follow everything   
22:38   
to the ladder and they still fail or they still get contaminated. So it's very useful to have something a resource   
22:44   
like this where you can you know kind of test things out and exchange sort of   
22:50   
anecdotes and see what works and see what doesn't. So this is uh figure one.   
22:57   
Here's an adult worm and next to two eggs. So these are the eggs. These are   
23:02   
embryos are contained in these eggs. And these eggs will hatch   
23:08   
at about the 600 cell stage and they'll continue to grow into different stage   
23:14   
larvae which then uh continue to grow into these 959   
23:21   
cell adults at least for the hermaphrodite. So you have a hermaphrodite worm here. You have the   
23:27   
eggs. These eggs will hatch and they'll little the little larvae will uncoil and   
23:34   
it'll grow and go through these different laral stages and then become an adult which then can lay its own   
23:40   
eggs. Those eggs um then will give rise to several hundred   
23:47   
worms. Um and then the worm will die and you'll have another generation. And that   
23:52   
whole generation takes only a couple of days. you don't need to wait that long to get a whole generation of worms. So,   
24:00   
it's very amendable to things like experimental evolution where you can um you know have defined mutants or you can   
24:08   
put them put the worms in different environments and see which ones survive and which ones don't. So there a lot of   
24:15   
things you can do here in seellians and you can do of course experimental evolution famously in   
24:23   
bacteria but also in yeast but C elegance offers this trade-off where you   
24:29   
have this very short generation time with this relatively complex physiology   
24:35   
and anatomy and in that sense we can look at things that are familiar to   
24:40   
humans. So we can look at things like metabolism or we can look at things like   
24:49   
like neurons or we can look at things like a conneto and they have some semblance to humans   
24:57   
and so then this is a picture of Sydney Brunner who started doing this enterprise and   
25:04   
then this is the growth in publications C elegance work. So if it says C   
25:09   
elegance in the title or the I guess in the abstract it gets indexed. And so you   
25:15   
can see though very clearly that the number of publications has basically grown well it grew exponentially in the   
25:23   
80s and 90s and 2000s and it's kind of reached a plateau in the 2010s and   
25:29   
2020s. Um but that's 120 or 12,000 publications a year. That's not bad. Uh   
25:37   
so this is definitely uh a robust area that uh people have really found a lot   
25:44   
of value and so you know one of the traditions of course in the field uh is sort of   
25:52   
sharing clones but also in data sharing and so uh John Solston in his uh work on   
25:59   
the lineage tree in C elegance was a famous example where those data were   
26:05   
shared and where there was a lot of advances made not just by Soulston's group and and Soulston being in the   
26:12   
originally in the Brunner group and then moving on to his own work but many other groups around the world.   
26:19   
So a lot of these early people who originated in the uh in the Sydney   
26:26   
Brunner group moved on to graduate students and then they you know shared   
26:32   
their data and their resources with other scientists and they established   
26:37   
this tradition in this community and it allowed us to get uh C elegance   
26:45   
as being the first animal with a sequence genome. as well as leading to this tradition of   
26:51   
open data sharing that influenced things like the human genome project and other large community projects that have move   
26:58   
human biology forward. So the human genome project started in 1990.   
27:04   
A lot of the genetics work in C elegance predates that. So a lot of the traditions that happened in C elegance   
27:11   
community were uh seen as important to any sort of uh integrative biology   
27:18   
enterprise. And so the human genome project incorporated a lot of these traditions of data sharing and other   
27:25   
types of community-based uh data sharing and information sharing.   
27:30   
Then of course as we moved on from the human genome project there have been other projects like the encode project   
27:36   
where we've had the same kind of focus on informatics and on data sharing and   
27:41   
having this open community. So they highlight three community   
27:48   
resources here. This has been critical for the success of C elegance research.   
27:54   
The first is the caneritis genetic center which curates and distributes strains.   
27:59   
The next is WormBase which is an online compendium of C elegance molecular knowledge and then worm atlas which is   
28:06   
the online resource for cellular and anatomical data. These resources have connected   
28:12   
individual independent labs to push science forward synergistically making   
28:17   
fundamental and unexpected advances that would otherwise have taken decades providing a great return on investment.   
28:25   
So they're going to start talking about the Nobel prizes now. So the first Nobel Prize was in 2002.   
28:33   
This was for the discoveries concerning genetic regulation of organ development in programmed cell death. So this was   
28:40   
this Nobel Prize was awarded to Sydney Briner, uh Robert Corvettz and John   
28:45   
Solston. And this was of course back in 2002 where they uh basically awarded the   
28:54   
prize to C elegance people who demonstrated aspects of development and   
29:01   
aspects of epitosis. So of course Solston was sort of the   
29:07   
person who first established the elegance as a model organism. He   
29:12   
articulated a clear and prophetic vision. Identify every cell in the worm and trace lineages. Investigate the   
29:19   
constancy of development and studied the genetic control by looking for mutants. And so that guided of course this is um   
29:28   
this had a antecedent in microbial genetics where we have these very tight   
29:34   
and advanced analytic methods that you can't necessarily do say in humans or at least at the time you couldn't do in   
29:40   
humans or in other model organisms like mouse or even in drosophila to some   
29:45   
extent. So this is really what we were trying to do here. Taking advantage of that transparency   
29:52   
microscopic size and small cell number. Solston heroically meticulously trace   
29:57   
the pattern of non gonatal cell divisions. This is of course the lineage tree. Uh from the single fertilized egg   
30:04   
to the mature adult which in conjunction with the sematic gonatal lineage define   
30:09   
the first and today only complete cell lineage of an animal. It's also described a largely invariant cell   
30:15   
lineage produced for the hermaphrodite 190 sematic cells   
30:22   
but remarkably only 959 of these cells were present in the adult. The other 131   
30:28   
initially look like typical cells but quickly underwent a series of stereotypical morphological changes that   
30:35   
culminated in their disappearance. So the lineage tree produces more than   
30:41   
959 cells from the point of the one cell   
30:47   
fertilized egg to the adult. And what happens of course is we have 959 in the   
30:53   
adult. We always have 959 in the adult. C elegance is what they call utellic   
30:59   
organism which means that there's an invariant number of cells unless you're talking about a defined mutant an   
31:05   
invariant number of cells in the adult in the adult.   
31:10   
So the cell lineage tree overproduces cells for the adult. So those 131 cells   
31:19   
uh the difference between 959 and the total output of the lineage tree   
31:25   
are cells that undergo programmed death. They basically die   
31:30   
uh a death that is planned, it's programmed and you know then maybe the   
31:37   
question is why? Well, you know, there are a lot of functions for cells that um   
31:43   
you know, cells live and serve their purpose and then die. And that's exactly what's happening here. Uh programmed   
31:50   
cell death, also caused the epitosis, had been known to be a widespread aspect of animal development. So if you look at   
31:56   
a tadpool's tail, they often overproduce cells and then progress back towards a   
32:02   
final shape or the formation of fingers and toes where your hand is this web   
32:08   
when you're very very early embryionic development. And then the cells in   
32:14   
between the digits will undergo programmed cell death when exposed to uh   
32:20   
a transcription factor. uh that uh basically defines the shape of the   
32:25   
fingers. So your your ancestors, biogenetic ancestors had webbed hands   
32:33   
basically or webbed uh front limbs. And so you lose those cells to get the   
32:40   
digits that you have on your hand. And this involves aptosis. Those cells die   
32:45   
off in a programmed way that they don't in say your uh   
32:52   
were amphibious cousins. So this is all kind of where we see this in nature and   
32:58   
of course we see this throughout nature but of course we want to understand this from the standpoint of a lineage tree of   
33:04   
a developmental lineage tree and what happens to those cells.   
33:10   
The challenge was to determine the me mechanistic basis of the striking phenomena. The starting point as for   
33:16   
many important studies using model organisms was a chemical mutagenesis screen for mutants that disrupt a   
33:22   
specific biological process. Solston identified the first cell death gene knock one which includes a nucleas that   
33:30   
degrades the DNA of the dying cell. A few years later, Edward Hedgecock   
33:35   
identified mutations in two genes said one and said two recorded for the   
33:40   
fagicitic engulfment of the dying cells and that lack said one and said two   
33:45   
function cell corpses persist. So this is all kind of involved the huge   
33:52   
genetic screen and they were able to find out what the mechanism for aptosis was and that this is conserved across   
34:00   
evolution. So this leads us to understanding maybe how   
34:06   
cell lineage abnormalities play a role in organ development in the genetic regulation of organ development   
34:14   
also but also leading to novel insights into different signaling pathways such   
34:19   
as EGFR rasc and then 12 notch pathways. Focusing this approach in aptosis, Ellis   
34:26   
and Horvitz performed a screen for mutations that eliminate the persistent purposes of said one mutants reasoning   
34:33   
that such mutants might include those in which the cells abnormally die instead live. This screen related screens were   
34:40   
spectacularly successful identifying the core molecular genetic components of an epotic pathway that is conserved across   
34:48   
the animal kingdom. Three proapotic genes EGL1 set four and   
34:54   
set three promote programmed cell death while a single epotic anti-apotic gene   
34:59   
said nine prevents program cell death. So this is kind of going over   
35:09   
this is a graphic that shows the conserved pathway for programmed cell death where you get this core pathway   
35:16   
that's activated for the kill that involves these different genes here EGL1   
35:21   
set 9 set 4 and set three set A activates   
35:26   
uh two other pathways which is where we have this pathway that engulfves and removes the corpse. So it   
35:34   
has this fagic act action that involves PSR1, said 5, said 2 and said 12. And   
35:41   
then they found the human orthologues. So these orthologes are found in humans,   
35:47   
but they were discovered in C elegant screens first, which are said one, said six, said seven, and said 10. So those   
35:54   
all work together to remove the cell to make sure that doesn't, you know, kind of stick around. we don't like to have   
36:01   
dead bodies around in our community. Uh same holds true for cells and so that's what this is. So then they highlight the   
36:09   
Canvitus genetic center that was established in 1979. This is a place where you can go it's a stock center   
36:16   
where you can order different lines of sea elegance to find mutants.   
36:22   
The Caner Habitat stock center not only accommodates strain requests but also   
36:29   
involves access to research and education and increasing that in the area of not only C elegance but in   
36:35   
genetics as well. So over 4,100 individual labs have obtained strains of   
36:42   
the CGC within the last 10 years. Um, more than 1,600 of these have official   
36:48   
worm lab designations required for naming strains and wheels.   
36:54   
Many of the other labs are primarily focused on other organisms, but look to the worm to explore homalologues of   
36:59   
their favorite genes. Often they can find strains pre-made and ready to order, streamlining the efforts required   
37:05   
to test the hypothesis. So the next Nobel Prize is in 2006. This   
37:12   
was for the discovery of RNA interference gene silencing by double stranded RNA. So this is used using   
37:18   
RNAI. This was awarded to Andrew Fer and Craig Melo. And they led research groups   
37:25   
that identified doublestranded RNA as a potent and specific trigger for RNAI and   
37:31   
consequent gene silencing in C elegant. So RNAi silences genes and there's this   
37:36   
uh trigger which is doublest stranded RNA that allows for this process to happen.   
37:43   
So this is a this discovery uncovered an ancient guided search mechanism that   
37:49   
cells use to recognize and regulate genetic information. These types of RNAi and other types of   
37:56   
small RNA pathways are universal. So this hasn't just segant specific but   
38:02   
happens across I guess the tree of life governing gene expression protecting genomes and shaping heredity.   
38:10   
RNAI has become a valuable tool for high throughput functional screens and individual intervention experiments.   
38:16   
While the stroll has been shared with genome editing genome editing methods such as crisper in more recent years,   
38:22   
both workflows share the features of combining production of limited or massive libraries of RNA guide sequences   
38:29   
that target specific genes with methods for introduction into cells, phenotyping   
38:34   
and assessment of causal relationships. So RNAI can be used to silence genes. We can use crisper and other methods to   
38:41   
more sort of more in a controlled manner slice out genes or cut out specific   
38:47   
stretches of DNA and you know but still you have a lot of value in RNAI based   
38:53   
screens uh which are standard for functional genomic approaches and cell biology genetics and biotechnology   
39:01   
and of course it did serve as a paradigm for the crisper methods that we have today   
39:07   
and So really the RNAi uh award was built on this whole idea of how you know   
39:15   
people discovered how doublestranded RNA structures participated or set up this   
39:21   
gene silencing process that people didn't really understand before   
39:27   
um you know being able to understand the structural requirements for RNA based silencing occurred through the use of   
39:33   
the ceiling in the model system. Then they talk about worm base which was established in the year 2000 and the   
39:40   
alliance of genome resources established in 2016. So again seeligans was the first animal   
39:48   
for which a whole genome sequence was available. So we had before the g se elegans genome we had bacterial genomes.   
39:56   
bacterial genomes were circular and rather small in size. The se elegance   
40:02   
genome was the first metazonean genome. We would get the human genome a couple   
40:07   
years later. We'd get east genomes. We'd get house genomes. We get all sorts of genomes in animals. But C elegance was   
40:13   
the first whole genome that was created for animals or sequenced for animals. And so this is   
40:21   
where, you know, we had this happen in our model organism first and then we had   
40:27   
our human and we had to have the model organism genomes. And in fact, that was a major part of the human genome project   
40:34   
was to create these analoges in in model organisms. So we could use some of that   
40:39   
information to inform the function of human genes. Just having the sequence isn't enough. We need to understand the   
40:45   
function in C elegance. That's fortunate because we can do experiments. We can target specific genes and specific   
40:52   
pathways much easier than we can do in humans. So we find though that nearly 40% of C   
40:59   
elegance genes of human ortholog based on extensive primary sequence conservation. So we have a lot of um   
41:07   
shared genetic material, shared genetic function between sea elegance and humans   
41:13   
and we can use that in you know looking at human health or looking at physiology   
41:20   
or some sort of pathway that might tell us something about say like   
41:26   
aptosis in humans. In addition, many additional worm genes   
41:31   
are functional orthologes of human genes recognizable by conserved domain structures and or AI assisted structural   
41:38   
predictions exemplified by LIN14, a direct target of the windfor microRNA.   
41:45   
And this of course is part of the 2024 Nobel Prize for which two of the authors   
41:52   
won. The genome sequence is generally a starting point for the creation and study of human disease models and is   
41:59   
integral to all studies of aging, neurobiology, development and physiology   
42:04   
with applications to human biology. And so the third Nobel prize was in   
42:10   
2008. This is for the discovery and development of greeneros and protein or GFP.   
42:16   
So GFP is actually something that occurs in nature. It occurs in a marine organism and it's generated uh there's   
42:24   
GFP and then there are other types of fluorescent proteins like RFP which is red fluorescent protein, YFP which is   
42:31   
yellow fluorescent protein and these proteins have been isolated from the natural populations and brought to the   
42:38   
lab to use as biological markers. So the idea is you will take like a cell   
42:44   
organism and you'll infect the cell or the organism with this fluorescent protein. You'll have a construct. You'll   
42:51   
infect the cell. You'll deliver the fluorescent protein into that cell and then it will bind with some uh you know   
42:58   
you have a binding uh sequence that's associated with the fluorescent protein   
43:04   
and it will bind to some say RNA of interest or protein of interest and then   
43:10   
once it binds to that thing it will show up in say like if you're doing some sort   
43:16   
of fluorescent imaging. So you have fluorescent imaging. Um   
43:23   
it's usually in the ultraviolet color spectrum and you can actually see these   
43:28   
markers as brightness. You see them as green brightness or red brightness. So it makes it very easy to localize a lot   
43:36   
of things that are expressed in cells. So this is of course an example of how   
43:41   
GFP is used in C elegance and in human cells and in organoids. So this is uh   
43:48   
touch receptors across human cells. You get uh you know things that identify a   
43:54   
touch receptor and the green fluorescent protein is expressed in those in those   
44:00   
receptors and you can see them here along the lateral lines of the worm. So   
44:06   
this shows this map and we can actually localize   
44:11   
these cells by that signal and you can take these images you can co-register   
44:17   
them with some sort of anatomical atlas and you can have spatial specificity   
44:23   
at you know a pretty good resolution with not a lot of noise. There is auto   
44:28   
things like autofllororesence and other things that can be corrected out using um imaging software but other other than   
44:34   
that you know it's actually a pretty indispensable tool for localizing different cells and different RNAs and   
44:42   
different proteins. This is the worm brain where we have these different fluorescent proteins that are used to   
44:48   
localize different cell types. You can see the different uh conneto cells here   
44:55   
in the in the anterior part of the worm. And again, you know, we're identifying   
45:00   
this by the fluoresence level. So, you know, the fluoresence level is often an important indicator as well. If it's   
45:06   
weakly fluorescent versus highly fluorescent, we can measure modify that fluoresence as a measure of say how   
45:13   
abundant a certain RNA is or a certain protein is. And that tells us something about what's going on in the cell. Is   
45:21   
the cell producing a lot of the substance or very little? And maybe that's a sign of like strong affinity or   
45:27   
weak affinity for a certain cell type. All sorts of ways that we can do this. And you see this in papers that we talk   
45:33   
about in these meetings where you have uh where people try to quantify the   
45:38   
signal and and make statements about their sample and or about their   
45:44   
treatment condition based on the fluoresence indicators in that image. So   
45:50   
then this is actually where we have green fluorescent protein with cherry red stain and it defines different   
45:56   
aspects of human stem cells, stem cell aggregates and human organoids.   
46:02   
So we can use uh green fluorescent proteins in combination with different stains. Uh and so this is kind of how   
46:11   
this will look under a microscope. You can combine signals and it can give you different pieces of information   
46:18   
localized to different parts of a cell or different cells or different parts of   
46:23   
what's becoming a tissue or more. So then they highlight worm atlas and worm atlas of course is an anatomical atlas   
46:32   
and there was a sort of a goal of creating something similar to an atlas of human anatomy but for sea elements.   
46:40   
And this is an example of the atlas where you take images like this and you   
46:47   
create these three-dimensional images like this. So you're taking something that's very hard to see and understand   
46:54   
in a microscopy image. I mean you can see the structure but it's hard to like visualize what that should look like in   
47:00   
anatomical context. You see a very faint uh uh worm body here, but then this   
47:06   
nerve coming up the ed interior to the anterior end of the worm from this   
47:12   
neuron AWC. So, you know, that's kind of hard to to understand and interpret. And so, we can   
47:19   
turn that into an illustration. Here we have you know not only the nerve but the   
47:25   
sheath of the nerve and then the cell and then the terminus at the edge of the   
47:30   
at the anterior edge of the worm and then the worm body around it. So we can understand all this in context using an   
47:37   
atlas. We can also play with the atlas in ways we can't play with the image and   
47:42   
we can also annotate the atlas in ways that we can't annotate an image. So we can combine different cells, combine   
47:50   
different nerves and annotate them, differentiate them, explore them uh   
47:56   
differentially and so forth. And so this is an you know other examples of the atlas where they have the slidable worm   
48:02   
where you go through uh different slices of the worm at different lengths of the body and see what's there. You can also   
48:10   
look at the atlas in terms of labeling things. So you can understand where cells are in context, where cells are in   
48:17   
the body of the word. So this is a very useful tool to have because you can actually go there and and think about   
48:25   
your problem. Think about, you know, if you're looking at a specific cell or a specific   
48:30   
lo anatomical location and how that sort of translates more generally to the rest   
48:35   
of the body. And so you know the thing about sea elegance is that's not the only nematode. There are other   
48:41   
nematodeses. Uh there are other nematodes that are model organisms. There are other natural populations of   
48:47   
nematodes. So there's the satellite model nematode prestus pacificus and a human parasitic   
48:55   
nematode strong. And so these are different nematodes   
49:01   
that have different numbers of cells in the adult. of different lineage trees   
49:06   
and all of this. Uh so there are differences in terms of different nematodeses that are actually pretty   
49:12   
closely related and so you know this is something where people are starting to   
49:18   
look at these other nematodeses as model organisms for different things and they want to make comparisons with sea   
49:23   
elegance and so it's important to have these resources not only for looking at   
49:29   
human disease but looking at these uh closely related nematodeses and looking at the differences.   
49:36   
Finally, we have the Nobel Prize in 2024. This is last year's Nobel Prize   
49:41   
for the discovery of microRNA and its role in post transcriptional gene regulation. So, this is of course where   
49:48   
we have our microRNA, not RNAI. It's a different type of RNA. It's not mRNA,   
49:53   
it's micro RNA. So micronas are very short RNAs that play a role in this   
49:58   
post-transcriptional gene regulation where you have translation of course which is where you turn a DNA sequence   
50:05   
into an RNA sequence. The RNAs will form secondary structure. Then they go to be   
50:11   
transcribed at the ribosome. Then the ribosome they get turned into amino acids. Then there's this gene   
50:18   
regulation before the assembly of the proteins that happens that modifies   
50:24   
those transcripts even further so that the protein looks very different from the gene sequence that produces it or   
50:31   
the gene sequences that produce it. So micronas are small non-coding RNAs   
50:37   
that play an important role in post- transanscriptional regulation of gene expression in plants and animals. So   
50:42   
micronas are widely applicable in life in plants and animals both not in   
50:49   
bacteria but this is this is just a you know this is still an important   
50:54   
discovery. The discovery of micronas emerged as an unexpected outcome of the Ambrose and RVkin labs studies during   
51:01   
the 80s and 90s of the lin and le seven genes of C elegance. Their roles in   
51:06   
controlling the timing of laral developmental events. So this is where we of course have these laral stages we   
51:13   
have going from L1 to L4 and they're these different um you know courses of   
51:20   
of development that can occur. you have in an organism where the adult always   
51:25   
has the same number of cells at least in the   
51:32   
at least in the hermaphrodite you have a lot of changes or adaptations that can   
51:38   
occur. So you have a starvation that you can have after L1.   
51:43   
You have the dower adaptation or the dower phase which can go from L2 to L4. And these are all   
51:51   
responses to extreme environmental conditions. Furthermore, during each laral stage,   
51:58   
you have cell growth, you have morphogenesis, and you're adding cells at that time. So   
52:04   
there are a lot of things going on in the in the laral stages that are quite interesting in finishing off the adult   
52:10   
worm from what's hatched. And so   
52:17   
there a lot of these things involve post-transcriptional regulation. And so these involve lin 7   
52:25   
uh for a half a dozen years after publication of the 1993 paper reporting the discovery of the first microna   
52:32   
lin 4. It was not clear whether this little non-code coding regulatory RNA   
52:37   
was merely a specialty of C elegance or representative of broadly conserved class of RNA regulators and of course it   
52:44   
was the latter or else they wouldn't be getting the Nobel Prize. The 1990 discovery that a second C   
52:50   
elegance microRNA light seven was conserved and sequenced across all violarian animals. Putting all doubts to   
52:58   
rest and in short order hundreds of mnas not mrnas but mnas were discovered   
53:05   
across the ukariots including humans. Strikingly, LED 7 is not only the only   
53:10   
microRNA to be deeply conserved across animals and in some cases even the specific target genes of conserved   
53:16   
micronas are conserved over vast evolutionary distances   
53:21   
emphasizing the fundamental importance of microna mediated gene regulatory mechanisms.   
53:27   
So why did we find micronas and C elegance first?   
53:32   
Well, we can work of course we're working with worm mutants and we're able to do these kind of unique mutations.   
53:40   
So lin 4 and let 7 you know as we have multiple defined mutants of each they   
53:48   
exhibited developmental timing phenotypes. So these are temporally disjointed expressions of juvenile and   
53:54   
adult sematic features in the same animal that of course because you have a very short uh   
54:01   
generation time you can observe those under microscope and pretty quickly put that together.   
54:08   
Um and so that's how they were able to discover this. This is an example of   
54:13   
conserved microna target target regulatory motifs. So you have these three processes on the left. You have   
54:21   
what happens in the worm in the middle in red and then what happens in humans on the right in blue. So for   
54:27   
morphagenesis is a process in the worm you get microRNA 51 and micro RNA 100   
54:36   
and that puts a break on HST 322. And so in humans we see a similar thing   
54:43   
with microna 100 putting a break on HS32.   
54:49   
So this is this is not exactly it's you know it's   
54:54   
homologues and paralogues acting the way they do. Uh then muscle physiology which   
55:00   
is another process uses microRNA 1 and it puts a break on these VHA genes VHA1   
55:07   
51 11 12 and 13 and then in humans we have MIR1   
55:14   
acting to put a break on ATP genes ATP 6V and different variants of that. So   
55:23   
again we have different name genes but they're related and the pathway is conserved because it's involving MIR1 in   
55:31   
both cases and it's being sort of you know it's it's putting a break on these other   
55:38   
gene the expression of these genes. So it's it's actively suppressing these genes those translation.   
55:46   
Then developmental timing we have in in the worm we have lin 4 mi or 125 we have   
55:53   
let 7 that puts a break on lin 28 and when you put a break on lin 28 that   
55:59   
puts a break on the L3 fate and extends the L2 fate. So the L2 fade is the second fate larval phase. It's extended   
56:06   
when lin 28 is suppressed. L3 occurs later and you get this extension of the   
56:13   
L2 fade. This is important in the daer phenotype that you see in development.   
56:20   
Uh then in humans we have MI 125 and let seven. So the same sort of pathway we   
56:28   
have lin 28 in humans and that puts a break on late competence and extends   
56:33   
early competence. So you're extending an earlier developmental fate in the same way you're doing this in the laral   
56:40   
stages. So it's fascinating that we have this sort of conservation even though the life history is very different and you   
56:48   
know we don't have laral stages in humans but we have the sort of uh you know we still have development and they   
56:54   
still it still comes from the same places but these microna uh regulatory mechanisms seem to be   
57:02   
pretty consistent across a wide range of the tree of life. So they conclude by   
57:08   
saying that the past half century of C elegance research compellingly demonstrates fundamental investigations   
57:15   
using experimental model organism and reveal conserved biological mechanisms   
57:21   
and greatly impact our understanding of human biology disease and the ways to develop novel therapeutics. It's fair to   
57:27   
say that all studies of C elegance have greatly enhanced and indeed would not be possible without the NIH funded shared   
57:35   
resources of the CGC worm base alliance and worm atlas. And if history is any   
57:40   
guide, the next half century will bring insights we cannot even imagine today. Insights that will again transform our   
57:46   
understanding of biology and our ability to treat disease. So this is great. This   
57:51   
is a nice uh sort of I think piece of public communication as much as a a   
57:57   
review paper in telling people how important C elegance research is, how central the NIH has been to this uh this   
58:05   
enterprise and then how wide ranging   
58:10   
you know you work with a neatode you say that doesn't seem to have any consequence and of course has great   
58:16   
consequence but you have to let people know what that consequence is. They have to understand what the impacts are and   
58:23   
indeed there are a lot of impacts here. So that's all for today. Uh, thank you   
58:29   
for watching to this point and I hope you learned
