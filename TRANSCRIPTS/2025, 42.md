## TRANSCRIPT   
0:01   
Hello. Hello. Hi. How are you?   
0:08   
Oh, fairly good. Good.   
0:14   
Okay. So, uh Okay. Well, we're we're waiting to see if we   
0:20   
can make any progress on stability of the integrity structures. Right.   
0:26   
be nice to throw one and say this is its stability. Yeah.   
0:33   
Yeah. I haven't done that yet.   
0:38   
But that Yeah. So, did you have anything more to say about that or I haven't I mean I haven't really thought about the   
0:45   
stability thing too much since we talked last but Okay. Well, I guess I was kind of like   
0:52   
Well, we'll see if I do. Yeah. Hussein said he wanted to give an update, but I told him, you know, I'd be   
0:58   
available now. I don't know if he's gonna show up, though. Yeah. Hello.   
1:04   
Hi. How are you? What was the Well, pretty good. I I thought maybe   
1:10   
this wasn't going to be on today, but Oh, well, yeah. Oh, well, I just wanted   
1:15   
the reference for that. And I um I'm sorry about the large dump of   
1:22   
papers I gave you, but it's sort of what I've been looking at.   
1:28   
When was that doing much with? When was that? That was last week or   
1:34   
just now or? Yeah, last week. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. I think I sent them to you last   
1:39   
Thursday. Uh yeah, I'll take go back and take a look. I don't know.   
1:45   
Somehow I don't remember it, but maybe I do and I Yeah, I've been busy. Okay. Yeah. Well, do do take a look at   
1:52   
them because there's some that are biological and some that are tensey   
1:57   
related. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I think I remember. Yeah, that's Yeah, you you probably be more   
2:03   
interested in the biological ones. Yeah. Rather than the tensey ones.   
2:10   
Yeah. I'm I'm having trouble with the 10segrity math. I don't know what to   
2:17   
study first. Like I need to study Lrangeian mechanics perhaps before   
2:24   
understanding the math for tenseity although I don't think that's quite right. I just I need the   
2:32   
prerequisites and I have no clue what they are. Okay.   
2:37   
So if somebody could like give me a hint as to what the prerequisites are for for   
2:44   
the study of the 10segrity math. I sent you several papers on that and if you   
2:50   
could tell me what I need to study then I could just go do it and then maybe it   
2:56   
understand what on earth they're talking about. My my linear algebra does help   
3:01   
but um it's more than linear algebra. This is Yeah.   
3:06   
some sort of complicated linear algebra. Yes. Yeah.   
3:13   
What did you Yeah. Well, I I'm   
3:19   
I'm fairly sure I have a an understanding of math to at least an   
3:25   
undergraduate uh level of um electrical engineering.   
3:33   
And this is like I don't know. Yeah,   
3:39   
I'll tell you. Yeah, I'll tell you what the kind of math you need to know more of. I mean, you have to go through. I   
3:46   
think we've gone through some of it, but I'll have to go back and make a list. So,   
3:52   
okay. Yeah, we really appreciate um that. Yeah, just   
3:59   
knowing where I need to go with this. I I'm I'm sure I have the background in math, but I need to know which direction   
4:07   
to take it next to understand it.   
4:12   
Yeah. All right. So, yeah, this I mean,   
4:18   
what was that? Uh Dr. Sharief did take one look at it and he said, "If you expect me to study   
4:26   
that, I don't have time, so I'm not doing it.   
4:31   
I'm going you don't like this guy is his base is math.   
4:36   
Okay. An electrical engineering professor whose base is mathematics. Yeah.   
4:42   
That's how he does all his projects. Yeah. And it's like and he didn't he didn't   
4:47   
know it well enough. Yeah. It's very specific to the problem. Yeah.   
4:54   
Okay. Welcome to the final diva worm of the year. Uh, a couple things I'd like to go over   
5:00   
before the end of the year. The first thing I'd like to talk about is that we   
5:05   
had our annual meeting last week, uh, last Tuesday, the openworm annual   
5:10   
meeting. And I gave a report on D.VARM and we also talked a little bit about   
5:16   
some of the things going on in openworm. Uh one of the big things is that uh   
5:22   
people are within the project are using um vibe coding to sort of get some older   
5:28   
things working. So one of the old things that we had that disappeared over the   
5:34   
years was the uh the iPhone app. There was an iPhone app where they did things with the worm simulation. And so that's   
5:42   
something they're trying to revive. Other legacy pieces of software that   
5:47   
they're trying to modernize and revive as well. So, you know, whatever your feelings   
5:53   
about vibe coding are, um, that is still a pretty useful thing to get old things   
6:00   
working again, especially in open source. I think that's a very good development. So, that's what's going on   
6:06   
there. And they're doing a bunch of other things that I really want to get into right now. Um, but suffice it to   
6:12   
say that, you know, open room is going strong. Now as for our work um I   
6:18   
developed um a talk for the annual report. Um this is the talk it's on   
6:26   
our YouTube channel. So it's about 41 minutes long and you can go through and look at all the things that we've done   
6:31   
this year. So, we didn't do as many publications as I had like would have hoped, but um still we did a lot of   
6:39   
topical deep dives and we've been doing research and hopefully in 2026 we can   
6:45   
get some of that published. Uh this is one example of something that   
6:51   
was talked about in the uh report. This is uh our work on multifysics and tense   
6:58   
integrity. So this year we talked a lot about multifysics models. We talked about models in which you have multiple   
7:04   
physical processes going on simultaneously. So in the embryo you might have flows   
7:10   
liquid flows. You might have structural issues. You might have in this case it   
7:15   
says thermal but it's really like say metabolism. And then you have electromag   
7:21   
in this case it says electromagnetism. You might have bio electricity. So those   
7:27   
are all going on at the same time. in developing cells and developing   
7:32   
connetos. And so this is a very u interesting way to approach embryogenesis. But the problem is of   
7:39   
course is that we can't necessarily model biological systems using conventional multifysics software. So   
7:47   
there are a couple things that are the problem there. Uh the first is that you know we want to be able to model   
7:52   
biological processes, birth death processes, differentiation processes, division. So   
8:00   
a lot of multifysics software deals with mechanical systems or you know basically   
8:06   
things that are non-living or don't have the traits that we want to incorporate from living systems. U another problem   
8:14   
of course is that a lot of the superstable structures that we want to model that represent uh complex tissue   
8:21   
dynamics uh are indeterminate structures in the eyes of the software. So this is where   
8:27   
we have multiple sources of say like compression that balance out and it   
8:33   
there's a mathematical inconsistency that won't allow for the proper modeling   
8:39   
of the dynamics. you end up with models that fail immediately and of course obviously that's not useful to us. So we   
8:46   
need to think about multifysics we need to think about this indeterminacy problem and then we need to think about   
8:52   
how tense segreges play a role in stable biological structures going from   
8:58   
something that's undifferiated to something that is stable and and robust.   
9:04   
So that's a little bit about the annual report. you can go to onto the YouTube channel and check that out. And   
9:11   
hopefully that gives us ideas about what we might want to do for next year. So, thinking about what we want to do for   
9:17   
next year. Obviously, we want to put some more publications out into the world. Um, also, you know, maybe if   
9:26   
you're interested in presenting at one of our meetings, please contact uh myself   
9:31   
uh and you know, you you'll be able to do that if you would like. Uh we also have opportunities with uh Google summer   
9:38   
of code. We have opportunities to work with openworm. They have an opportunity   
9:44   
called a studentship which is where they you know usually have to be some sort of   
9:50   
student either a graduate student or an undergraduate student. You have to have an interest in working with biological   
9:56   
data and you have to have some sort of really focused project that is portable   
10:01   
to this studentship. But the benefit of that of course is that you work with open worm and you   
10:08   
develop something useful. So it might be an opportunity for some of you   
10:14   
for others of you. If you're interested in doing research, if you're interested in building um you know projects out   
10:22   
you might do that in conjunction with your coursework or with something that you want to accomplish in your   
10:28   
professional career. That's something else we can do as well. We have if you go through our YouTube channel there are   
10:33   
a number of topics that might be of interest to people not just the 10 segrity work but we also have things um   
10:40   
having to do with with uh biological questions. Uh we're looking at   
10:47   
centishium and sea elegance which are cells that have multiple nuclei. We're looking at that in conjunction with the   
10:54   
lineage tree. We also have uh applied machine learning projects uh largely   
11:01   
these days focused around graph neural networks uh but also a lot of machine learning   
11:07   
oriented towards development and other types of mathematical modeling oriented towards development as well.   
11:15   
To finish off the year I wanted to talk about a couple of papers. This is the first paper I want to talk   
11:21   
about. So this is a bioarchchive preprint and the name of this paper is living neuros sheets   
11:28   
engineering readily deployable neural architectures and this is from a number of authors uh   
11:34   
John Begs who does a lot of things with uh neuro criticality   
11:39   
uh gazola who's at UI here safe was at UIU   
11:45   
and um so there are a lot of authors on this paper and so it this This looks   
11:51   
like an interesting sort of bio inpired architecture for yeah sort of as a maybe   
11:56   
as a replacement for neural networks but definitely as a neural control mechanism. So why don't we go through this   
12:03   
abstract? Motivated by the brain's extraordinary processing abilities, the promise of   
12:09   
queriable neural models and the potential for biohybrid computing.   
12:14   
We pres present living neuros sheets practical malleable and modular   
12:20   
platforms for the realization of complex in vitro living neural architectures.   
12:25   
bio inpired or beyond evolutionary precedent. By innovating porous sheets,   
12:31   
substrates employed for millennia in the form of paper are here reimagined,   
12:36   
inheriting neural function and exceptional versatility. Through pre-programmed paracity,   
12:41   
deposited neurons are held in place for durable and reproducible spatial control   
12:47   
by cutting, folding, and stacking. Elaborate neural topologies can be designed, batch fabricated and modularly   
12:55   
composed in combination with tissue matched optoer electronics. Neuros   
13:00   
sheets deliver a powerful foundation with a multimodal integration of neural motifs.   
13:06   
This is illustrated via planer tissues, giri inspired manifolds and laminer   
13:12   
cortical mimics where we demonstrate control over trainment, synchronization,   
13:18   
propagation, suppression and augmentation dynamics recapitulating   
13:23   
fundamental building blocks of invivo neural activity. So this is uh what   
13:29   
they're doing here is they're creating a material and they're building in these features of basically a network and then   
13:38   
they're building higher order structures with them. So if you know of course   
13:43   
about work on um gyion sulkai in the human uh brain and the surface of the   
13:49   
human brain where the human brain the neoortex has expanded to the point where   
13:56   
it's so large that needs to fold and it folds up quite intricately to fit into   
14:02   
the brain case and those folds sort of their undulations are known as giri or   
14:08   
giri in sulkai. And so these folds um allow for this   
14:14   
huge sheet to fit within the brain case. But then there are other features of these folds that produce a certain   
14:23   
topological complexity. And so um this is something that I guess they're   
14:28   
addressing here by allowing us to build these sheets that have some sort of   
14:33   
neural control function and then configuring the sheets in different ways. You can fold them. you can stack   
14:40   
them, you can cut them in and and form different shapes depending on how they would be um implemented. So this is kind   
14:48   
of an interesting advance uh from the standpoint of you know the   
14:53   
physical aspect of networks. How do you put networks sort of on a material? And   
14:59   
then you know of course we talked about um   
15:06   
we've talked about neurorgonoids where you can grow up structures you can grow up culture three-dimensional structures   
15:13   
of fairly high complexity. Um but we haven't really talked about sculpting   
15:19   
those neuralorgganoids into highly modular and and uh   
15:24   
configurable sheets. So that's what they're doing here.   
15:29   
So they start out and say, "What if living neural systems could be engineered as programmable circuits with   
15:36   
freedom to prescribe architectures that information flow and enable rich   
15:41   
multimodal interaction? No longer constrained by the complexity of the intact brain, neural topologies   
15:48   
could be synthesized to recapitulate hallmarks of sensory processing, perception or learning, advancing   
15:55   
fundamental understanding and promoting biohybrid technologies that harness life   
16:01   
for computation. So this is uh what they're calling in vitro neuroscience   
16:07   
as you know along with your neurorgonoids and many other in vitro approaches. Uh while in vitro   
16:14   
neuroscience has long hinted at this transform transformative potential, existing technologies fall short of   
16:21   
delivering engineering level control over neural design, scalability, reproducibility and simplicity. Key   
16:28   
requirements are efficient prototyping, systematic interrogation and widespread   
16:34   
adoption. So here they get into brain organoids and they compare what they're doing with   
16:40   
brain organoids. So brain organoids powerful developmental and disease models uh offer limited structural   
16:48   
control and reproducibility. Bioprinting which is their alternative   
16:53   
so they're printing structures on the sheets and then reconfiguring them provides versatility.   
17:00   
However, neural applications remain circumscribed and important by material constraints. In both cases, challenges   
17:08   
tied to cell migration and structural integrity persist. Left unchecked,   
17:13   
neural migration a hallmark of development and D disrupts mature   
17:19   
architectures where structural consistency is instead critical for sustaining reliable function over time.   
17:26   
So on these sheets, of course, they don't have any developmental aspect. So it's just you have to know what you want   
17:32   
to fabricate, you fabricate it, you build the structure, and there you go. in brain organoids and of course in the   
17:38   
brain itself we have these uh developmental processes. So we have neurom migration and of course these are   
17:45   
things that can con sort of self-organize or configure these types   
17:50   
of systems neuroorg brain organoids or uh natural developmental neural systems   
17:57   
and these are of course um guided by cues that uh you know are going to lead   
18:02   
to some known functional uh circuit. So you know you're dealing with something   
18:09   
that you know you if you want to if you know exactly what you want to fabricate this uh the the neuros sheets is sort of   
18:16   
better but if you want to self-organize a circuit or if you want to build upon   
18:22   
the self-organizing potential of an organism then you need things like neural migration and in fact this would   
18:27   
disrupt what was going on in the in the narrow sheet. So that's that's kind of   
18:32   
what they're getting at with this comparison between the technologies. Uh now they they mention that both   
18:38   
technologies suffer from high barriers to entry. So consequently in vitro studies of   
18:44   
neural processing continue to rely on 2D cultures. So you know we have   
18:49   
two-dimensional cultures where we can record activity and we can grow those pretty well with different cell types or   
18:56   
you know we can reprogram cells to neural cells or we can work with neural precursors or neural stem cells. But you   
19:04   
know of course then when you move to the third dimension that's when you start to get problems you know with in terms of   
19:10   
uh scaling things up uh and and that's what they're getting at here.   
19:15   
So 2D cultures are prized for their simplicity, but they're unable to replicate the hierarchical complexity of   
19:22   
native neural tissue. So just having that two-dimensional that that sheet of   
19:27   
cells um you can't replicate that complexity. You just have a bunch of   
19:32   
cells in a dish that maybe have some spatial complexity but not any hierarchal complexity that is is of   
19:40   
note. So in this context we introduce living neuros sheets malleable biohybrid   
19:46   
platforms that enable neural design freedom streamline fabrication and   
19:52   
robust interrogation. Ora sheets exceptionally versatile materials of the millennial history of   
19:58   
diverse applications are to cut to design innovated folded and modularly assembled before placement   
20:06   
onto opto electronic interfaces. So they're using this in conjunction with a lot of the opto electronic technologies   
20:12   
that we have so we can stimulate them and record from them and have this as   
20:18   
sort of a closed loop system. This workflow is intuitive as handling a sheet of paper offer scalable control   
20:26   
and enables deployment for reproducible experimentation within seconds. So they   
20:31   
mentioned you know how do you have like how do you print neurons onto a sheet in   
20:36   
the first place? So importantly, neuronal bodies are held in place through pre-programmed paracity which   
20:43   
prevents cell migration and supports the formation of robust macro architectures   
20:49   
while also allowing neural projections to traverse the pores and establish interconnected 3D networks. So you have   
20:56   
these sheets where you have the neuronal bodies that they sit in in sort of their well then they can make connections with   
21:02   
other neurons in a threedimensional matrix. um you want to prevent cell   
21:08   
migration. So if you have sort of a design for a circuit, you can print out that circuit, you can put the neurons,   
21:15   
seed it with neurons, and then you have your network. And the neurons can't move   
21:20   
around, although you know, maybe that's something that would yield an interesting result. We're interested in   
21:27   
control here. So we want to keep those things constant from a fundamental standpoint. As   
21:33   
synaptic connectivity or what they term the micro architecture is continuously   
21:38   
remodeled by plasticity and maturation. The control afforded by neurosheets over macroscale network organization allows   
21:46   
us to decouple structural from functional change and this of course is important for different types of   
21:53   
neuroscience investigation and computation. The reversible integration with opto   
21:59   
electronics and permits us to systematically broke our architectural motifs shape emergent neural dynamics.   
22:06   
So this paper I'm talking about is this living narrow sheets engineering readily   
22:11   
deployable neural architectures. This is from the bioarchchive. It was published I think last week or a   
22:18   
couple weeks ago. So this is um they're talking about these um   
22:24   
different types of I guess they're doing bioprinting and this is actually something Morgan is interested in. So   
22:32   
you know printing out uh neuros sheets which have like neurons on them and then   
22:38   
they can build like they can print the sheets out and then configure them into threedimensional structures. So they can   
22:45   
have the neurons on the sheets configure the sheets in different ways and the neurons can connect to form this   
22:51   
three-dimensional structure. And they're saying migration is important to building brain structure.   
22:59   
Yes. Yes. Yeah. That's uh well they're saying that   
23:04   
they don't they can't have migration in these sheets but you can also you know   
23:11   
what they're interested in is the synaptic connectivity. So it's like the neurons will send out axonal processes   
23:19   
and then when they meet other axonal processes they build synapses and the synapses uh enable the connection   
23:25   
between the cells. So you know although you could have a developmental structure like you know what you see in something   
23:32   
like a neural organoid and you get a lot of migration there and you get all these interesting structures that are sort of   
23:39   
like what you see in a developing brain but this is kind of where you know   
23:44   
exactly what kind of network you want. You print it out and you can configure it.   
23:50   
That's okay. So yeah, they're they're kind of   
23:56   
thinking about uh planer neural tissues of varying topology and and this allows   
24:03   
us maybe to study things like information encoding in trainment synchronization and propagation. So uh   
24:11   
these are hallmarks of invivo neural activity and in sensory processing memory and recall. So you have these   
24:17   
kind of test beds. for looking at these very simple problem or what would become simple problems of information encoding.   
24:25   
Um and then drawing on this we designed networks that autonomously enhance and   
24:31   
suppress encoded information illustrating the importance of macroscale topology in orchestrating   
24:37   
emergent neural dynamics by expanding the design space through mechanical buckling and folding. So again we have   
24:44   
this aspect of folding and buckling like we see in the neoccortical sheets in   
24:50   
human brain development u where you have a sheet that's so large   
24:55   
it has to buckle to fit into the brain case. In this case, you might want to fit your large sheet into like a small   
25:02   
space like a robotic um vehicle or maybe something like you   
25:08   
know if you want to do some sort of transplantation in humans uh to replace a piece of brain   
25:14   
tissue or you know have a small restricted space where you need to fit   
25:19   
this tissue. You fold it up and get this kind of Yeah, this allows   
25:25   
for that. Um, okay. But the there's layers that in the   
25:31   
brain and they're developed from the neurons growing   
25:37   
um in 3D. Yeah, they do they do configure themselves in 3D, but you know, the idea   
25:44   
is that they kind of have these connections that are vertical as well as horizontal so that things go up and down   
25:50   
these columns. Um, and so you have a bunch of cortical columns and then you   
25:55   
have the sheet which is a series of cortical columns in parallel and then that sheet folds up. So it's like this   
26:03   
really complex topology of uh and then the information   
26:08   
processing happens both vertically and horizontally. So vertically up and down sheet   
26:13   
horizontally across columns. So, you know, that's kind of what the   
26:18   
people doing um hierarchical temporal modeling are doing. They're looking at   
26:23   
these cortical uh columns and using that as the unit of computation.   
26:29   
So, that' be interesting to see like hierarchical temporal modeling people get into this paper,   
26:35   
see what they think about it. But uh I'm not a I know something about   
26:40   
hierarchical temporal modeling but I I couldn't give you the like the the   
26:46   
critique that's needed here. Um oh okay   
26:51   
yeah by expanding the design space okay they realize motifs inspired by guri and   
26:57   
sulky structures present in the cortical lamina associated with higher order cognitive functions. So this is where   
27:04   
they're getting into this analogy with the neoortical folding. These compliant   
27:09   
neural manifolds can serve as models to investigate the role of curved packings and processing or can be deployed into   
27:15   
formable robots for embedded neuromuscular control. And then through word lastly through modular stacking we   
27:23   
build reductionist cortical mimics that are top bottom electrically interfaced   
27:29   
demonstrating activity propagation and synchronization in laminer construct. So this is where they're talking about top   
27:36   
bottom meaning they have these cortical columns that are you know but in this case what they're trying to do is just   
27:42   
have like places where you can access this information processing structure. So if you have a robot you know, you   
27:49   
have some sensory input, you have these layers, and then you have the output to   
27:55   
the aector, something like that. Um, and so that's what they're getting.   
28:00   
And so this is an example of their neuros sheet. This is fabrication and structural characterization.   
28:07   
So this is a here is um the laser cutting the the fabrication process.   
28:13   
They have this laser cutting of filter paper. Then they build these features into the surface. They have this fiber   
28:20   
network. Um that's the design. Then the intervation in B you have P and PDMS   
28:27   
substrate. You suspend the cells and then you have this uh then you grow them   
28:33   
in this uh medium. Three is the fluorescent imaging. So   
28:38   
once you you have the design and then you have the fabrication and you get the neurons in this in these structures, you   
28:46   
want to confirm to see if the neurons actually are in the structure and we can see that the neurons um are fluesing   
28:54   
properly and that you can define the edge of the sheet. So you can find   
28:59   
exactly where they've ended up and confirm that. uh D is characterization   
29:05   
where you have uh this is uh electron microscopy. So we have the neural cells   
29:12   
and the fibers. We can see those in the electron microscopy on the feature. Uh   
29:18   
you have neural cells here. And so this bar is 30 micron. So we're dealing with a pretty small structure. Um it's not   
29:26   
quite a nanoructure, but it's a micro structure. So you have this these different um   
29:33   
uh configurations of the neural cells. Um this is so this is the cell side   
29:40   
where the cells are um you know they're placed in these wells and then they're   
29:45   
intervating u this the structure and they're they're making connections. So you can see that you have the cell   
29:51   
bodies that are separate but they're making connections between each other. The opposing side, we have no cells on   
29:59   
that side. So, we only have the cells on the side we want. So, we can have greater control. Uh the opposing side is   
30:08   
where we see things like cellulose acetate and neurites. Uh so, things that are be supporting that substrate of uh   
30:16   
the substrate and then the neur neurons on the other side. This is the amino staining. So we can see what you know   
30:23   
that the cells are doing things that they're expressing different things. And then this is batch fabrication.   
30:31   
Um and that's kind of where they're going across scales   
30:36   
uh where they're doing different these different sheets in parallel. So that's what you can see here.   
30:44   
Okay. So that's that's just kind of an example of what they're doing. Um   
30:51   
if you're interested in the the microructures and the fabrication   
30:57   
um basically they begin by selecting biocompatible materials of pore sizes tailored to simultaneously confined cell   
31:04   
somomas enable efficient hydrogel infusion and support neurite extension.   
31:10   
So they have to pick sort of biocompatible materials that allow for   
31:16   
sort of or allow for the compliance needed for cells to sort of you know   
31:21   
find a place to settle uh establish their exonal processes and survive in   
31:28   
that environment for any period of time. So that's what they're trying to do   
31:33   
there. Um, and so they need to be able to have a material that supports neurite   
31:38   
extension both laterally and orthogonally throughout the sheet volume. And so what they want to   
31:44   
eventually do is achieve three-dimensional connectivity. And they're trying to of course mimic   
31:49   
the radial interfacing of the alo cortex and neoortex. And so again, they're   
31:54   
mimicking the neoortex in these cortical columns with simplicity and broad accessibility   
32:00   
in mind. We consider two cost-effective and widely available solutions. The   
32:06   
first is fiber reinforced cellulose acetate filters. And then we have tracked etched   
32:13   
polycarbonate filters with pore diameters ranging from 0.8 to 20 microns   
32:19   
and thicknesses ranging from 32 to 135 microns.   
32:25   
So um they eventually picked the 100   
32:30   
micron thick cellulose acetate filters with a five micron pore size. Um the   
32:36   
application using 32 micron thick polycarbonate filters with 20 micron pores is highlighted in figure five as   
32:44   
an alternative. And so they just kind of try to characterize this as much as possible to see what's optimal.   
32:52   
Um the treated constructs are then placed on a hydrophobic poly uh PDMS   
32:58   
substrate to establish a wetability contrast. This contrast enables precise   
33:03   
confinement of liquids within the seating area causing droplets to beat up   
33:08   
thus ensuring accurate control over the deposited hy hydrogen volume and cell density. So they use the substrate   
33:15   
material to uh control the cells to make sure they don't migrate away. In this   
33:21   
case, we don't want migration. We want something that will uh be maintained in   
33:26   
in sort of these beads. So, we don't want to necessarily have we want to have   
33:32   
this hydrophobic surface so that we can have beading so that we can constrain   
33:37   
where the cell body is. Um and so that's what they're doing here. Um next   
33:44   
collagen matriel hydrogel is infused to provide provide defined mechanical and   
33:50   
biochemical cues that support the maturation of normal networks. The   
33:55   
resulting sheet hydrogel constructs which will serve as tissue culture substrates will be batch fabricated   
34:02   
characterized and stored. Modularity also permits tapping into the existing infrastructure for sheet   
34:09   
functionalization for micrfluidic integration the flexible electronic   
34:14   
pattern. Um so yeah then they they talk about how they raise the neurons how they get   
34:20   
those uh the neurons to survive and then they talk a little bit about um how they   
34:26   
confirm that the networks are active and that the cells are on the substrate and   
34:32   
things like that. uh then they do of course opto electronic interfacing. So they want to   
34:39   
be able to uh record and stimulate the cells as well as image them.   
34:47   
So this is functional characterization. This is the neuros sheet in a sort of a   
34:52   
cell culture container. Um this is the MIV platform   
34:58   
and you can see that they've you know they're recording from this micro micro electro electrode array uh 512 channels   
35:06   
and you have the channels over time. So actually we can find not only that the   
35:12   
uh we can characterize not only that the cells are in place and that they're active through the the stains that we   
35:18   
saw or the m of the fluoresence that we saw but we can also do electric   
35:24   
electrical recordings and we find that the neurons produce these global and spatially localized bursts.   
35:31   
So if you know I noticed that John Begs is on this paper. So of course he does the things uh with neural avalanches.   
35:38   
It's been his kind of thing that he's done over the years neuro criticality neural avalanches. And so one of the   
35:45   
things that happens in in neural cultures or in in neuro groups populations of neurons   
35:51   
is that they produce these bursts that are sort of exhibit this sort of   
35:57   
self-organized criticality. that is they produce these bursts uh that conform to   
36:03   
a power law over time. So you get these bursts that are irregular in their time interval and you get these in a neural   
36:11   
population. So you get a bunch of neurons that sort of uh exhibit bursts   
36:17   
um you know at these irregular points in time and the idea is that they're related to all sorts of different uh   
36:24   
collective phenomena. And so you see this across the across the culture u   
36:31   
across the sheet in this case but you also see this localized. So you see sometimes a few neurons or maybe even a   
36:37   
single neuron will exhibit a burst and burstiness is related to how the cells   
36:43   
are connected and how they're sort of um exchanging information. Uh so the thing   
36:50   
that you need to know from this is that their exchange of information is nonlinear and so it results in these   
36:56   
bursts. So you see that you know from some of the channels you get like these   
37:01   
localized bursts over maybe a few channels whereas you get this global   
37:07   
burst where almost all of the channels are exhibiting this burstiness at one time. And so you see this of course   
37:13   
because what frequency sorry what frequency is the bursting?   
37:19   
Um I'm not sure what let's see if they have it in here. Um   
37:25   
I guess you could calculate it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean yeah they don't   
37:30   
really get into that here. Yeah but   
37:35   
seven eight 10. So once every   
37:42   
six seconds or something. Yeah, roughly. I mean, it's it's it's not like it's there's a there's an   
37:49   
average to it, but it's, you know, it doesn't conform exactly to the average. It's kind of the idea.   
37:55   
A a cure for uh or a um partial cure for Alzheimer's   
38:02   
is uh um 40 hertz.   
38:07   
um stimulation of the brain with electrode. Yeah. That's some pioneering work at the   
38:15   
University of Manitoba. Okay. And it slows down Alzheimer's. It helps   
38:21   
keep them um functional longer. Yeah. Um it and it improves their um   
38:32   
their their functioning. Yeah.   
38:37   
Yeah. Anyway, it it was interesting. I It was on YouTube. They they put the conference   
38:44   
on YouTube. Okay. Um I could also get get you that if you're   
38:51   
interested, but yeah, it just uh the 40 hertz seemed to be the   
38:57   
what they chose for stimulation frequency. Right. Right. There's this old idea of   
39:04   
binding which is where like there's this global signal I think it's at around 40   
39:09   
hertz uh where like different parts of the brain are all kind of synchronized in the frequency band the activity and   
39:18   
so then the idea was that that's sort of a global signal of consciousness or something I don't know that's a   
39:24   
literature that you don't really want to go too deep into but uh it's uh that was   
39:29   
an idea people had at one time and I guess it's like a an aspect of the EEG   
39:36   
spectrum that's really interesting to people. Yeah. I Well, I I got to see uh this is   
39:43   
Dr. Mosavi, University of Manitoba. I got to see her equipment. I tried it out on my arm and   
39:50   
it made my arm tingly. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, she she um   
39:58   
attaches electrodes to the forehead and um   
40:04   
and has tried it out on um older population   
40:11   
who has Alzheimer's and it it does improve cognitive   
40:17   
functioning. Yeah. Anyway,   
40:23   
yeah. Okay. So, yeah, this and then so they're   
40:29   
re able to reproduce these bursts which you see in uh   
40:34   
you know in in in actual brains. So that's good. You also see this in microelerode array recordings of   
40:42   
two-dimensional cultures. So that's also good. Uh then we have this optical   
40:47   
stimulation. So you have a difference between sort of a stimulation of the culture and and so if you're familiar   
40:55   
with optogenetics they usually use some sort of uh genetic marker to uh make the cell responsive to   
41:03   
light and then they provide a light flash and then the cells respond to the light. So you have this light source,   
41:11   
you get this stimulation and then you get this response afterwards. So that's   
41:16   
what they're doing the optical stimulation and people do this oftent times   
41:22   
this method is you know they've done this within living in invivo brains   
41:28   
where they have uh you know like they've done this in mice where they stimulate part of the cortex. they can basically   
41:35   
uh turn it on and off with this optical stimulation. Uh and so they can uh get greater   
41:42   
control over different types of say like motor uh dysfunctions or other types of   
41:47   
dysfunctions in the brain, seizures and so forth. You stimulate the cells with light or you you know basically entrain   
41:56   
them to a light source and they can uh you know you get these types of results.   
42:01   
So that's what they're doing here. Then they look at the normalized firing rate. Um they're looking at sort of this   
42:09   
adaptation curve where there's consistent response after reuse.   
42:16   
Uh we have electrical stimulation. So you know we want to know if like stimulation is changing the activity of   
42:24   
the of the neuronal culture as opposed to just being a random thing that's thrown in there. you know, if you have a   
42:31   
light source and you're kind of stimulating cells, you can do that and it's, you know, it could just be a   
42:36   
random phenomena. So, if they're not connected in any particular way or if they're not connected at all, they can   
42:42   
respond to the light source and it's all random and that doesn't really mimic the   
42:49   
brain or doesn't really do anything that the brain would do. In this case, what they're doing is they're verifying that   
42:55   
there's some um stimulated aspect to the firing rate that they're patterns of   
43:01   
correlation. All right. Then they do some calcium imaging. It's calcium indicator and this   
43:09   
intensity curve over time. So they can characterize the bursting by the   
43:15   
intensity of this calcium indicator over time. They actually have for 50 k 50,000   
43:22   
cells versus 150,000 cells. So I guess this suggests that there's some sort of density dependence here that um there's   
43:31   
you know I guess basically they say here primary cortical neurons exhibit density   
43:37   
dependent dynamics lower density showing mostly asynchronous activity and higher   
43:42   
densities producing periodic synchronized responses. That's what they've got here. So that's   
43:49   
and then of course they talk about planer tissue topologies. So this is where we're looking at the   
43:54   
geometries of neural dynamics and control. They refer to a directed   
44:00   
emergence of intractably complex microscopic connectivity by a well- definfined   
44:05   
macroscopic boundary conditions. And of course this is something that's needed is this directed emergence. Meaning that   
44:13   
you know you can have a network that wires itself sort of spontaneously and like we talked about up here you   
44:20   
know you can have the spontaneous response and that's not necessarily very useful. Now in an in vitro in an invivo   
44:28   
context you have chemical cues we have the substrate that is sort of uh you   
44:35   
know formed we have cell migration and this matrix uh that's formed in   
44:41   
development that enables sort of this directed emergence in biological systems. So what they're trying to do is   
44:47   
mimic sort of what development provides to an emerging brain or emerging conneto   
44:55   
in in an in vitro setting. And so this is of course a problem with neurorgonoids   
45:01   
trying to get you know useful uh collections of tissues out of basically   
45:07   
putting a bunch of cells into a culture and hoping that they sort of self-organize in the right way. And so   
45:14   
that's kind of what they're getting at with direct emergence. Um, and so   
45:19   
they're looking at different ways to do this topologically as well. So to impart   
45:24   
dynamics of transport, directionality, and integration, we move beyond genus   
45:29   
zero typologies which are square tissues and adopt genus one configurations   
45:35   
enabling branching and merging. So this is actually I guess mathematical topology I'm not familiar with.   
45:43   
um these different uh genre of topologies but this is again moving from the square   
45:49   
tissue something with some biological like structure. Um so then we begin with   
45:57   
a ring motif which is genus1 topology characterized by a periodic boundary condition that allows inputs to diverge,   
46:04   
converge and self- interact. We'll see in figure three what that looks like. Ring-like motifs are common across   
46:11   
neural systems from the fly central complex including head direction to   
46:16   
nidarian nerve nets around the oral or bell margins of jellyfish. So these are   
46:22   
things that coordinate feeding and locomotion. So they're what they're trying to do is they're trying to mimic   
46:27   
different types of ring-like motifs of cells in biological systems. you know   
46:33   
like it we have the fly central complex we have the nidaria nerve nets uh we   
46:40   
also have the sea elegance um ring uh the nerve ring and sea   
46:46   
elegance but they don't mention it here uh so basically we have this common topology that we see in in this in in   
46:54   
different organisms uh so that's what they're trying to do with these sheets ring topologies are   
47:01   
then cut treated and invated with either wild tape or transfected motor neurons   
47:08   
uh guided by preliminary observations of rectangular strip systems. Uh the ring's   
47:13   
outer and inner diameters are set to 4 mm and 10 10 mm respectively.   
47:20   
This is large enough to prevent spontaneous global synchronization and enable long range act activity   
47:27   
propagation yet small enough to limit dissipation and allow dynamics to spatially   
47:33   
interact. So basically they want to prevent sort of   
47:39   
synchronization by means of being like too small. So you know you can have like   
47:45   
if you have a very small area um cells can spontaneously sort of   
47:51   
synchronize their activity and they're you know they don't they really kind of interact globally and   
47:57   
that isn't really the kind of emerg directed emergence that we want. We want this system to be large enough to sort   
48:04   
of represent a larger area of space uh but also synchronize through a   
48:11   
combination of local and global connections. And so that's what they're doing here. They're just trying to find   
48:17   
the optimal size for this structure, but they don't want to make them too big   
48:22   
so that they can't have uh cells spatially interact   
48:27   
and dissipate into something that isn't self-organized.   
48:33   
So, there's this trade-off. And, you know, again, I don't know if this is a function of the technology or a function   
48:39   
of the biology, but they they try to find the sweet spot in between. Um and   
48:45   
so to enable precise electrophysiological monitoring and manipulation   
48:51   
custom ring-shaped highdensity microelerode arrays are fabricated and matched to the tissue. So they   
48:58   
hypothesize that tooidal tissues which are these rings or these donuts of   
49:04   
tissue which can effectively be thought of as a periodic axism axisymmetric   
49:10   
branch. So this is where you know these droids or are basically branches and   
49:16   
they're sort of periodic uh will support bifurcation dynamics,   
49:24   
parallel transport and two stream interaction. Such systems thus represent minimal models for investigating   
49:30   
mechanisms of signal copy, redundancy, propagation or refractory period   
49:36   
localization. All mechanisms biologically and computationally relevant. So this is uh figure three.   
49:44   
These are these planer tissue topologies. So you have up at the top you have the ring tissues. So you have   
49:50   
these rings. They're basically like donuts. And remember they're three-dimensional.   
49:55   
And so you have this ring that's uh the tooid. You characterize this by looking   
50:02   
at the dappy stain. You're looking at the stain that confirms the normal bodies. And then you're looking at a   
50:08   
stain that confirms the astrittes. So you have these three stains that you need to do to verify   
50:15   
uh localization of neurons and supporting tissues and all that. Then they have their microelerodes in here   
50:22   
and the ring tissue. You can just you know it characterized all of that. Uh   
50:28   
then they they characterize the electrophysiology in three. And in four we have this uh optical stimulation. We   
50:37   
have this bifurcation and self-copying. We have these ripples that occur in the   
50:43   
activity. This radio average. We have propagation along the ring and then this   
50:49   
self-suppression because of the refractory period. So basically we have this stimulation at one end of the of   
50:56   
the of the Taurus. It goes in both directions and it hits the other side   
51:02   
and there's this refractory period once it hits the other side where there's self-suppression. So if you make these   
51:07   
too small, you get the self-suppression really early and it doesn't allow for proper propagation.   
51:14   
Um but if you make them too large, the propagation is way too long and it you   
51:19   
know so that there's this this happy medium here that you have that you need   
51:25   
to achieve. And so they have these are I guess spatial recordings. So you see the   
51:31   
uh strength of the signal in hertz. So you see that the signal propagates outward and it decays over time. So it's   
51:39   
you know it's it's not like doesn't just kind of uh go as far as it wants. It   
51:46   
kind of dies out at the original source of stimulation and continues on through the Taurus. So this is all to say that   
51:54   
the um geometry is very important. It's it's you know it's not only important   
52:00   
for applications but it's important to get the dynamics right on these topologies because after all neural   
52:06   
tissues aren't just networks they're networks on some sort of topology.   
52:12   
This is a Y tissue uh construct where they have this branching demonstrated. So they have the bottom branch, the left   
52:19   
and right branch. Again they're characterizing the structure of the dappy stain, the neurons and the astroytes. Then you have this structure   
52:27   
where you have a stimulation site at either br end of either branch. You have   
52:32   
a recording site down at the base of either branch and in the bottom branch.   
52:37   
And so then they're looking at these bands, these EEG bands. So this is a seven hertz beta band uh signal. This is   
52:47   
a three herz delta band signal. And then they're looking at concurrent stimulation on each branch. So in this   
52:54   
case on the right branch we have the seven hertz theta which is stimulating from the right. You see that most of the   
53:00   
activity is on the right branch. The stimulation at three hertz of delta which is stimulation from the left   
53:06   
branch. So you see that they basically remain in their branches maybe propagate   
53:12   
out of the other branches a little bit. But then when you get this concurrent stimulation of three hertz delta and   
53:17   
seven hertz theta, you get this one herz slow delta that occurs in the bottom   
53:23   
branch. So that's an interesting uh point that they're making here. So this   
53:28   
is um you know where they're doing this uh they're looking at mean firing rate   
53:34   
activity after stimulation and they're looking at where this is encoding in these different neurons. So   
53:43   
um this is what they call signal signal augmentation down on the bottom branch   
53:49   
where you have this concurrent stimulation coming down both branches and then combining in the bottom branch   
53:57   
there sort of this uh emer sort of directed emergent property.   
54:04   
Okay. And then then of course they talk about tissue manifolds. So having established planer spatial   
54:10   
programmability, we next extend design space through folding and buckling to create functionally innervated   
54:16   
threedimensional manifolds which are these compliant neural structures unattainable with current approaches.   
54:22   
Being able to bend and fold them into spaces and uh you know having them sort   
54:28   
of be these analogies of the gear and sulsai of human brains. Uh so this is a   
54:35   
way we can achieve dense packing and support rich connectivity. And so from a   
54:40   
biohybrid robotic perspective, integrating nervous systems into deformable motile platforms demands   
54:47   
neural architectures that conform to dynamic body shapes while maintaining functional integrity. So actually this   
54:54   
is something that we talked about in uh this is a while back in our Saturday morning neurosin meeting where we talked   
55:02   
about these um structures that they used for designing neural networks on   
55:08   
substrates where they used origami and kuragami. Um, I think Morgan might remember this   
55:16   
uh paper, but it's basically where they take uh sheets and they fold them up. If   
55:23   
you're familiar with origami, it's folding up the sheet in a certain way so that you can build a complex structure.   
55:29   
In the case of origami, you could take a flat sheet of paper, fold it up in the right way, and form like a swan or form   
55:36   
some sort of um structure uh that you know is quite complex just from a flat   
55:44   
sheet of paper. Uh kuragami is a little bit different, but it's basically very similar technique and you can design   
55:50   
different things from a flat surface in in that way as well. So that's kind of   
55:57   
the the kirami is um   
56:02   
it's the sections of it are joined by triangles, small triangles.   
56:07   
Okay. And that's why I thought it was similar to a cell structure with the the   
56:13   
triangular junctions. Yeah. Yeah. Try junctions.   
56:19   
Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, they use it for molecular structures quite often. Yeah. Yeah.   
56:28   
And you can form some interesting meta materials using that that idea,   
56:34   
right? Yeah. This is something experimenting with.   
56:40   
Okay. Can reconfigure the topologies. You can, you know, take a sheet and fold it in different ways.   
56:47   
Um, so that's that's kind of what they're trying to do here. And yeah, it's there's a whole literature on it.   
56:52   
I'm not sure if people are doing it to look directly at like uh tri junctions   
56:57   
or cellular structures, but that actually be interesting um in the especially in the context of   
57:03   
like intense segreg.   
57:10   
Yeah, it just was an interesting idea. Um, I tried to make a 2D cellular   
57:17   
structure and it um it was it was good. It kind of worked   
57:25   
but I didn't pursue it because um it would have taken extra time.   
57:31   
Yeah. But I didn't have time. So, um yeah, and I put something in the   
57:39   
chat. That's the YouTube um channel where Dr. Msami Masavi presented some of   
57:46   
her research. She actually got her grad students to make a a program where you   
57:51   
could drive as um an older adult as as part of keeping your brain sharp. And   
57:59   
that's part of part of this. You do the brain stimulation and then you um have   
58:07   
homework to do and part of it trying to drive with the simulation program and   
58:14   
find your way through a house and there there's a a bunch of um games for um   
58:22   
Alzheimer's patients that she's made. Yeah,   
58:28   
it's good. Oh, it's it's pretty interesting research. If if my brain was   
58:34   
going, I think I' i'd prefer to uh spend my time doing games on the computer,   
58:41   
like driving rather than just uh sitting staring at a wall. So,   
58:48   
that's what they recommend. So, I think it's great. Yeah. Yes. So, the the stuff she's come up   
58:56   
with is is very good. Yeah. So, let me finish up the paper. Just   
59:03   
just this last part. I think it's probably the Yeah. So, that's they're doing origami and curigami. And it's   
59:10   
interesting that they're actually building now this sort of these folded structures.   
59:16   
And, you know, this is where they're kind of building these structures with neurons. They're recording from them.   
59:23   
and they're finding out that they're able to replicate these uh avalanches as   
59:29   
we talked about uh where you have these bursts, the spontaneous burstiness. Sometimes the bursts are very small,   
59:35   
sometimes they're very large and global. And you're able to detect these in the structures and so we're actually able to   
59:45   
um you know realize some neural control in these folded structures. So, um,   
59:51   
that's kind of what they're getting at with this. And then the next step, of   
59:56   
course, is to make laminer tissues or laminar circuits that have layers. And so, then we're getting into these   
1:00:02   
cortical columns and other things like that. So, one of the reasons I wanted to   
1:00:07   
talk about this paper as well is because it's really interesting and it does it   
1:00:13   
it does tie in a lot with what Morgan is trying to do and one of his interests.   
1:00:18   
So he's interested in bioprinting and sort of these hybrid 3D structures, but   
1:00:24   
he's been talking about it of course in terms of neurorgonoids or assemblids. And we talked about what those are,   
1:00:30   
which are these three-dimensional cultures where you put a bunch you seated with a bunch of precursor cells   
1:00:36   
or stem cells. They differentiate in in the in vitro. give it the right chemical   
1:00:42   
composition and it will produce hopefully   
1:00:48   
uh structures that you know maybe they're layered structures or multisellular structures. You're getting   
1:00:54   
basically a sort of a pseudo uh embryo where   
1:00:59   
you're getting different structures or different types of cells that are functionally independent and   
1:01:05   
interdependent. So they're kind of forming circuits but at that's that   
1:01:10   
level of control it's hard to maintain a level of control over those and you know then he has this aspect of of biorinting   
1:01:18   
so printing them out on sheets and depositing them in in sort of a more um   
1:01:24   
desirable set of topologies and things like that. So, I'm hoping that Morgan takes a look at this and gives some   
1:01:32   
feedback on what he thinks about the technology because I think it's really interesting.   
1:01:37   
Yeah. Don't forget about the mechanical stimulation. Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely. And they don't, you know, you talk about the   
1:01:43   
optical stimulation, but of course when you have these structures, there is the mechanical aspect. Of course they   
1:01:50   
constrain migration of cells but there are these other uh so I don't think they actually make contact in that way but   
1:01:58   
they're actually sending their processes out into the structure and so like   
1:02:04   
they're inter interacting in ways that you know might be very interesting especially in the organoids we can't   
1:02:11   
control the so we have a lot of mechanations there that I think they need to take pay attention   
1:02:18   
to how They're being mechanically manipulated as well. Like the stress and   
1:02:24   
strains in in the gel are important as well. Yeah.   
1:02:29   
If they don't know how come the results worked here and they didn't work over there, look at the mechanics.   
1:02:36   
Yeah. Yeah. So, it just it's an important   
1:02:42   
aspect of that and they need to pay attention. That's all. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. But it looks like yeah, some of   
1:02:49   
these structures are kind of tensey structures too perhaps.   
1:02:55   
Yeah. Like they're they're intention or they should be in tension in order to operate   
1:03:02   
correctly. Um anyways, well that's all for today. Um yeah,   
1:03:10   
thanks for Okay, just just saying just saying our cells are intention in our body.   
1:03:15   
Oh yeah, definitely. It just is. Yeah. Anyways, uh do take a look at at the   
1:03:22   
YouTube video. You'll find it interesting, I'm sure. Yeah. Um   
1:03:28   
and uh yeah, have a good holiday and uh Okay. Yeah. See you in the new year.   
1:03:36   
Okay. All right. Yes. Have a good holiday. You too.   
1:03:42   
Bye.
