Hello. Hi. How are you? Um, good.     
0:08     
It looks just as messy behind me as it did before, but actually I've made progress.     
0:13     
Oh, good.     
0:19     
That's great. Hello, Morgan. Susan,     
0:25     
hello. All right. Um, so I don't know updates     
0:31     
if anyone has them. Updates. Um,     
0:38     
for me, not much. I've read the paper I told you about last week and it's     
0:44     
heavily into mechanical engineering math     
0:49     
and it it it does um it doesn't do the compartmentalization     
0:57     
of cells. It it it doesn't     
1:03     
doesn't do that. It it does um where is the paper?     
1:09     
overall structure, but cells aren't aren't necessarily     
1:14     
connected in that way. So, um it's just doing a material.     
1:21     
Okay. So, I don't know. Um I don't know how useful it is to me for me.     
1:27     
Right. And the one on tense, I think I told you     
1:35     
about it and I don't know where it is. um is might be useful for it's useful     
1:41     
for studying tensity of cells because it's looking at the elastic part of the     
1:50     
cells or the strings being nonelastic like it's for that end of things and     
1:58     
tense especially in living things aren't aren't elastic like they're not     
2:04     
necessarily they're as elastic his steel for instance. So um so that that paper is     
2:12     
useful for for studying that end of things.     
2:22     
That's good. Um so I I know you sent those papers on     
2:28     
um tense segrity and I was reading over them     
2:33     
um and I have some slides and I think I'm going to assemble a slideshow and     
2:39     
we'll go through it     
2:44     
and u we'll look at like you know some of the things because you asked me what     
2:49     
are the mathematics Okay. I'm sorry about this.     
2:59     
I try to bury it. Okay. Here. I don't know. Can you hear it better or less?     
3:05     
Less, I guess. So, uh yeah. So you asked me about the     
3:11     
mathematics of tenserity and uh you know I don't I mean I guess I     
3:17     
know some of the mathematics uh but I want to go through and see what they're actually doing and you know kind of the     
3:23     
the way it works. I mean I mean there there's a lot of matrix     
3:29     
algebra there's a lot of uh sort of continuous     
3:35     
dynamics things like that but I'm going to go through some of the things they talk about and some of the concepts and     
3:42     
then it looks like people use different mathematical tools to kind of try to     
3:48     
solve or address some of these areas the the title of of This paper that I'm     
3:55     
interested in is called a modified dynamic relaxation formfinding method     
4:03     
for general tense seg 10segrity structures with inextensible tensile     
4:09     
members. Oh, that's a long title. I'll put it in the I'll put it in the     
4:16     
chat. Just Yeah.     
4:22     
All right. All right. So that's that's good. Um     
4:28     
yeah, one of the things is form finding. Uh one of the things they do in the literature. So um I don't know if we had     
4:35     
any other updates before we start. All right. Why don't we get started? Oh, go ahead.     
4:41     
Yeah, just one question I have to ask. Um just a second. Yeah. uh last meet uh we     
4:49     
I joined and we discussed that you suggested me to go through the greater apples and understand the codes for the     
4:54     
last year's project of uh devote pg um so yeah I went through it I had a bunch     
5:00     
of questions so I had put it I put it on um slack to you in your DMs so yeah we     
5:06     
will continue discussion there or can we like so how do we work that out uh actually why don't I present this and     
5:13     
then afterwards you can uh go over your questions I think that would be good to do within the meeting.     
5:20     
Sure. Sure. Thank you. Sure. Okay. Thank you. All right. All right. So, let's start.     
5:25     
All right. So, uh like I said, you know, there's a lot of math you can use. Different papers use different meth     
5:31     
techniques for doing different things. And I'm going to add to this slideshow as we go and change things so that we     
5:38     
have a slideshow of things that we know. Kind of like a handbook maybe um at the     
5:44     
end. That's where I'm going with this. So one concept is constrained     
5:49     
optimization. So as you can imagine um and we'll see this tenseity structures are quite     
5:56     
complex and you want to be able to optimize them for the properties of tensgrity. So you     
6:03     
can generate a lot of different types of structures but only a small subset of     
6:09     
those are tense structures having all the properties that you would like. And     
6:15     
you know, you want to be able to optimize your structure for those properties, but you want to do that. You     
6:22     
know, you can't just uh do a brute force search. Obviously, we know that uh doesn't work particularly well. It's     
6:30     
hard to find the things that you know are tense segreg.     
6:37     
And so this is an equation that they had in one of the papers. They proposed uh     
6:43     
this simple equation which is basically FK over IK which gives you qk which is     
6:51     
force density. So we're solving for force density. We have our individual forces. So that means that the     
6:58     
individual components of the model um are you know we're going to account for     
7:05     
each of these. we're going to sum them up or summarize them in some way and we're going to minimize those in terms     
7:12     
of force density. So we're minimizing our force density and we're doing you know we're using the individual forces     
7:18     
of the components but then we're also interested in the length of the components as well or the     
7:25     
the length scale or the size and and so there's IK which is length or LK I guess     
7:31     
which is length and then that is that proportion is force density     
7:37     
and so what we're doing here is we're optimizing an objective function while adhering specific constraints. So there     
7:45     
are a lot of ways to do optimization. You know, you're using some sort of algorithm usually to enforce the     
7:51     
constraints and find the optimal solutions. All sorts of algorithmic ways     
7:56     
to do this. Uh mathematical ways you can solve for this and so forth. So there     
8:03     
numeric ways as well. So that's constrained optimization.     
8:08     
And so that's and then there are some other things that we need to do to sort of get to that point of optimizing for     
8:16     
these tensity structures. So I I like this model that they introduced in this paper mathematics of     
8:23     
stable tenseity structures. This is Harish at all. This is um on the archive     
8:30     
and what they do is they talk about the mathematics of stable structures. So remember optimal structures have the     
8:37     
properties of tense segre but they also have to be stable. So you don't want to have something that is technically a     
8:45     
tense segrity but isn't you know stable either statically or dynamically. So you     
8:51     
know we obviously want a stable 10segrity structure that's static. I mean we want to be able to have     
8:57     
something that has these properties of super stability and so forth. But     
9:03     
especially for biology, uh, we want to have this dynamic structure. So if you're building like,     
9:09     
you know, a geodeic dome, that's a static tense structure. You know, it's     
9:15     
just going to sit there and you're going to load it with things. And if you've ever seen the Epcot Center, um, or, you     
9:22     
know, if you've ever seen these 10segrity domes that people built, um,     
9:28     
and it's like a a sphere, the top of a sphere with with a bunch of, uh, triangular tilings on it then that's     
9:35     
basically the the structure and these are superstable structures um Buckminister Fuller talked about them     
9:42     
classified them etc those are static tense structures     
9:48     
dynamic tense structures are going to be things that twist and bend and those are the things that are interesting to     
9:54     
biology because biology of course things are always twisting and bending and curving and and so that dynamic aspect     
10:01     
is important but this is a model that they use for static I mean they're not just static     
10:08     
they're also dynamic but this I think this simplifies it this is called the kite model of 10segretes so this is a     
10:16     
kite if you you know if you flown a kite you know this is the basic structure of a kite I mean they have very complex     
10:22     
kites but like your basic kite is this thing that's a     
10:28     
like a diamond shape with an elongated bottom Um and then they're cross bars     
10:35     
and those things then are parts of the tensgrity and so they actually can take a kite and     
10:43     
visualize the tenseity very simple tensity um and then you know classify the     
10:49     
different components. So a kite model shows us that a     
10:54     
tensgrity consists of b points in space. So the first thing we need are specific points in space. They don't need to be     
11:01     
like specific to anything um like in the environment. They just need to be there,     
11:08     
you know, have a relation with one another. So, you know, we're not talking about a substrate. We're not talking     
11:14     
about like anchoring the points in anything else. It's just kind of like a free floating tense segrity structure.     
11:22     
So, a tense segrity consists of B points in space. And now they're going to start using     
11:28     
notation. So we have notation of n rods.     
11:33     
We have two rods. These are these uh double lines that go across. These are     
11:38     
the crossarss. Uh now the notation is interesting because in different even within this     
11:46     
this paper they use different notation and the notation gets a little sloppy     
11:51     
with respect to consistency. So sometimes people refer to rods as R sometimes N. Um     
12:00     
let me see am I right on this or I think I have this legend backwards but um yeah     
12:05     
there two rods the double lines that should be what I have for M should be N and and vice versa.     
12:12     
Uh we have four beads which are B. So that's where we have the the the     
12:18     
circles, the gray circles, and those are kind of the end points of each sort of     
12:24     
directional dimension. So like you know our edges are connected by these these     
12:30     
beads. If you think about a graph that those are the nodes of the graph     
12:36     
and n and m are the um edges of the graph. So we can use a graph     
12:42     
representation to represent this kite and characterize the graph statistics     
12:47     
um and then of course expand this out to networks. So we can now build um you     
12:53     
know not only more complex kites but then we can move to the dynamic case     
12:59     
where the dynam you know where we can characterize the dynamics we can characterize the translations. We'll     
13:05     
talk about that in a little bit but basically that's the kind of thing we have. So we can use a graph model or we     
13:12     
can use this just basic characterization of the different components here. Um and     
13:18     
so then we have M or sometimes in the literature they call C which are the cables. There are four cables. Those are     
13:25     
the single lines and those are basically the topological configuration. So we're     
13:32     
using uh we're going in the direction of topology.     
13:37     
So there's a whole mathematics of topology that if you dive in with both feet, you'll probably get lost. Um but     
13:45     
if you think about this in terms of graphs and then of course we know that     
13:51     
we can use graphs to characterize topology. So you know for example in this kite we     
13:57     
have simplicies right? We have if you're familiar with simplectic analysis or     
14:04     
simplectic representations we can build a graph you know where you have diamonds     
14:11     
triangles uh squares so we have all these shapes     
14:17     
embedded within this graph and the idea is that we can characterize     
14:24     
different nodes or in this case beads to say what that the boundaries of that shape. So, we have how many triangles do     
14:31     
we have in this shape? Well, we have four. You know, we have a triangle. Um,     
14:38     
you know, I don't have them labeled, but this bead, this bead, this bead, this     
14:43     
bead, this bead, this bead, and we have two triangles in the other in on the     
14:48     
other dimension. So, we have four triangles, and we can just take those triangles out, and we can characterize     
14:55     
the properties there as well. So there are a lot of things we can do with this mathematically. We can turn it into a     
15:02     
sort of a a set of simplices. We can have a graph a standard graph. We can do a lot of things there.     
15:09     
But the basic idea is we want a topology that's specific in space with spatial relations.     
15:15     
So the way they define it here further is that the topology consists of the set     
15:20     
R with unordered pairs. And this is where we're going to build a matrix of     
15:26     
interactions between the the I guess the uh the beads which would be J. So we'd     
15:33     
have um unordered pairs J. So again in a     
15:39     
graph we have beads which are the nodes. The nodes have connections and unordered     
15:44     
just means that you can go in either direction and characterize the interactions between I and J E element     
15:51     
and J element. So e element and j element. You could be interested in the relation in this direction or in this     
15:58     
direction. We don't care. Um and so we have uh this pairwise relation which is     
16:04     
going to give us a matrix of these relations and then once we have the matrix we can do matrix algebra with     
16:11     
them. Um so there are paralyzed relations for rods and cables and so we     
16:17     
have this these relations we have the the rods which are the lines of cables     
16:23     
which are these double lines. And this is also important because we not only     
16:29     
want to have points in space that are configured in space, but we want to have     
16:34     
we want to be aware of length constraints. meaning that we don't want to have uh rods and cables of any old     
16:42     
length because you know if a a structure is of a certain size it might be a tense segrity but if it's a longer in one     
16:49     
dimension or another it might not be no longer be a tense segrity. So length is important here. If we can characterize     
16:56     
the length of a tensgrity u as you can imagine this kite if this     
17:01     
end which is longer now were infinitely longer and had just continued on forever     
17:07     
it would be less stable in that direction than it otherwise would be. So that tense integrity breaks down and so     
17:14     
length is important position is important and the relations are important.     
17:21     
The other thing that talk about in the papers is are these form finding methods. That's at Susan's paper of     
17:28     
interest mentioned in that very long title which was where they're doing dynamic form finding. There other there     
17:35     
are all sorts of methods for form finding and this comes from um architecture. So this is a very     
17:41     
interdicciplinary area. They do form finding and architecture. Like I said, when they build tent integrities in     
17:47     
architecture, they want to be able to find the forms that are statically well, they're statically the most     
17:54     
efficient, but also sometimes dynamically because remember, if you have a structure, it has to yield loads.     
18:01     
It has to be, you know, behave super stable with respect to wind and rain and all these other things, earthquakes that     
18:10     
change the, you know, might might um perturb the structure of the tense.     
18:15     
So the idea is that you want to find the best forms especially when you have     
18:20     
large tensity structures and so they do this in architecture. They also do this     
18:25     
in embodied robotics and I have a a a reference um a couple references by John Reel who     
18:33     
does a lot of work with evolutionary robotics and embodied robotics. So that     
18:39     
there's form finding there as well. This is this is origami     
18:44     
and it is related to tense segrity. Yeah. Um but it has uh well a paper folding     
18:53     
aspect to it. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of there's there's a hot area in like in nanote     
19:01     
technology and in uh embodied robotics like they're using origami and curigami     
19:08     
and I know I think we talked about this before where they're using these folding techniques to find structures and where     
19:16     
they're using it to build more complex structures that just have like a flat surface and then they fold it up. So     
19:22     
form finding yeah they use it not just for tensities um but they use it for other things as     
19:28     
well. But the basic idea of form finding is where they have like a universe of     
19:34     
forms or like a a latent space of forms. You might think of it that way or like     
19:41     
you know we talk about fitness spaces. You could have a space of morphologies     
19:46     
where you have all possible combinations and then you try to search that space for the optimal structures, the optimal     
19:54     
solutions. And that's that's form finding. And the     
20:00     
the idea behind form finding is very simple. You know, you use an algorithm or you use some sort of uh constraint     
20:06     
criterion to find the things that are most likely to give you the answer. You're approximating the answer.     
20:13     
you know this you're not using brute force search you're using this very focused search     
20:20     
and so you know what we want to do is we want to find uh the correct forms and so     
20:27     
we want to do this for static structures but also for dynamic structures so this is where we have to evaluate forms not     
20:34     
only statically but like under rotation and translation as well so that means     
20:40     
that I can pick a structure that is maybe stable if it's static, meaning it     
20:47     
doesn't change its configuration at all or its orientation. And so if I have, you know, I find     
20:53     
something that's a good tense integrity, it's static. That's great. But then if I rotate it, it's no longer super stable     
21:00     
and so forth. So that's out. And then I find something that's both static and     
21:05     
dynamic in in in its structure, then I I can select that.     
21:12     
So there's a lot that goes into tenseity form findings but other kinds of form     
21:17     
findings as well and um you know there are different mathematical techniques     
21:22     
but they're what they're doing here is just kind of um characterizing this. So     
21:29     
these different uh interaction matrices these J uh     
21:36     
matrices so rig and cig which are the end positions and help us find an     
21:42     
optimal distance between beads B. So basically we have our beads in in a in     
21:47     
specific locations and then we try different um sort of end positions or     
21:52     
lengths of the rods and you know and the different uh connections between the     
21:58     
beads. And so that's what we're doing here. We're just kind of looking at these. And of course as you translate or     
22:05     
rotate a shape there those um there you know those lengths are going to change     
22:11     
the angles are going to change and we can evaluate them with using these     
22:16     
matrices and so uh set R which concludes all of     
22:22     
these interactions all of these J so RI and CI would all be in set R and that     
22:29     
defines the static configurational space. So we want to be able to have the     
22:34     
static configurational space and then search that configurational space. So if     
22:39     
you if you're familiar of course with protein folding, you know that protein folding it is incredibly hard problem     
22:46     
from a computational standpoint. You also know that alpha fold has done a very good job of getting at that space     
22:54     
and finding the optimal configurations for proteins. You know also that protein folding and     
23:02     
uh what you might call form finding and proteomics is this didn't just start with alpha     
23:09     
fold. They didn't just apply alpha fold to the problem and solve it more or less. They've used physics engines to do     
23:17     
this for for years and years for decades even. And this is something of course     
23:23     
that um may be useful to tense. It may not be useful to tense because     
23:30     
you know we're looking in terms of protein folding. We're kind of looking at the same problem. We're looking at the static structure. We're looking at     
23:37     
the amino acid structure. We're looking at the topology, but we're also looking at way fold over time. So we can as long     
23:45     
as we can simulate a long enough time course     
23:50     
um and by long enough time course you know we're talking about     
23:56     
you know maybe one or two milliseconds um which isn't very much time but for a     
24:03     
protein that's enough to see how it folds and if it's like u functional. Um     
24:09     
we can we can then evaluate them. Um it's hard to you know, 10 segreities.     
24:14     
How long do you need to simulate them to see how they behave on a translation     
24:19     
rotation? It might be quite quite a long time. In biological terms, of course, a     
24:25     
long time is it could be several it could be a millisecond. Um, it could be maybe years. You know,     
24:34     
we don't know what the time course is for this. So you know we can apply computational methods to this     
24:42     
and look at the dynamics. Um but it's hard and it's even hard to do this with static structures because if the     
24:49     
structures are sufficiently complex if they have enough beads and I've just given you the four beads but if we had     
24:56     
4,000 beads then that's also another bigger problem. So um so again when we     
25:03     
talk about static we're talking about the position position is more or less stable but the you know the length of     
25:10     
the rods and everything vary. And then when we talk about dynamic we talk about     
25:16     
translation. We're rotating the structure. We're rotating you know maybe     
25:21     
we're moving the beads into different positions as the thing moves. We want to     
25:27     
characterize this continuous movement. So in the dynamic case configuration of     
25:32     
space is reduced more by considering only those things that are stable under rotation. So what we're doing with the     
25:39     
dynamic aspect of this is not just saying we only you know we only care about those things that are stable     
25:46     
dynamically. It also helps us to winnow down that list of     
25:53     
you know probable stable structures. And again, we don't know what sta structures     
25:58     
are stable until we actually test them experimentally or build a model. So we     
26:04     
don't know that um from just the search, but it helps us to winnow down those     
26:09     
possibilities because it's a very large space as with proteins. So that's what     
26:15     
we're doing there. We're just applying more and more constraints to find a smaller set of solutions.     
26:22     
And then our uh design tense integrities employ methods that lead to string deficient structures. So another thing     
26:29     
we want to do is we want to be able to um simulate these things not just in terms     
26:37     
of their basic structure and their rotation but we want to find thing you     
26:43     
know other types of properties where we have soft swinging modes.     
26:48     
um we want to find some of the properties like the lack of rigidity and     
26:53     
those are things that we can't just apply engineering tools to. We maybe we need to have new tools or we need to use     
27:00     
new methods to find those. So I wasn't and I haven't gone through the papers     
27:05     
yet but I wasn't clear on if there were any really good methods that people have identified and I think the point here is     
27:12     
that there are no really good u established methods of doing this. So it's kind of an open problem. You have     
27:19     
those these things exist. You can use different methods but there's no really good method for it. So it's hard to say     
27:26     
what would be the best method. Okay. Um     
27:31     
so this is a paper and this is where you know this is coming from this field of embodied robotics. This is not it it's a     
27:39     
computational technique. So I'm not going to talk about any math here. There's math underlying this but um the     
27:47     
idea is we're going to do form finding topological form finding which is uh     
27:52     
nominally static. This is this paper Herman at all     
27:57     
basic investigations on a compliant 2D tense grid for the use of in soft     
28:03     
robotic applications. This is where they have these grids, these tensgrity grids     
28:09     
where they're going to do form finding by drawing different structures within each cell of this this grid. And they're     
28:16     
going to compare the different structures. So the red lines here are the segments of the compressed members.     
28:24     
The thin black lines are tensioned members. And then the gray marked areas,     
28:29     
these cells that are gray, are elementary tensity cells. So if you this     
28:35     
and I didn't dig enough deep enough in this paper to really understand it intimately so I'm probably missing     
28:41     
things here but basically this grid is is the the whole tense integrity     
28:47     
structure you have these red lines which are the compress they they behave under     
28:52     
compression the thin black lines between are the tension elements and then the     
28:57     
gray marked regions these different cells that are gray are the elementary tensgrity cells I guess that means     
29:03     
they're the stable integrity structures of the lot. Um so we have various     
29:10     
polygons arranged in a variety of patterns that can be used as basic geometries or fully filled 2D grids with     
29:18     
edgetoedge tessillations. We have these tessillations across the grid which     
29:23     
means they're just different ways of of configuring these lines, these red lines. And so you see that there are     
29:30     
different strategies here. You know, some of them the u red lines, the     
29:37     
compression lines kind of go up to the corners. In some cases, they kind of branch off     
29:43     
before the corners and they have contact with the compression or the tensioned U     
29:49     
members out on the edge. And there different configurations that we can test this way. So, we can test all sorts     
29:57     
of different configurations that we can get a handle on the geometry. much better. Um, but this is again, you     
30:05     
know, uh, topology. This is, um, you know, there's a whole mathematics of     
30:11     
tilings and things like that. And that's where they need to be hexagon tiles.     
30:18     
Uh, I didn't see it in the paper, but yeah, I mean, that's like kind of the basic thing, the hexagons. Um, but yeah,     
30:28     
I didn't really dive in this papers there. Actually, they have a couple of papers from this group where they're     
30:34     
doing different methods. They might have them there.     
30:42     
Okay. So, this is like um so this is where     
30:48     
they have different types of these tilings and they're classifying them. So     
30:54     
they have 6S, 8DS, 8S, 4D, 2S and 8S,     
31:00     
4D. And this is where we have D and S stand for S stands for side centers and     
31:07     
D stands for diagonal corner points. So diagonal corner points is where you have a point that hits the diagonal and the     
31:14     
diagonal corner. And then the side centers are points at the sides and you     
31:20     
can differentiate between those and you have different motifs that um you can characterize using this method.     
31:28     
So there are different tilings and there's a whole mathematics of tilings and you know it's related to topology.     
31:34     
Basically we're trying to find the optimal topology here. Now in in in embodied robotics they want     
31:41     
to build these super stable soft robots. So you know you have soft robotics where you want to have compliant materials but     
31:48     
you also want to make the body super stable and that is actually a nice connection of biology because in cells     
31:55     
you also have this imperative that you want to optimize for these compliant     
32:00     
materials membrane is pretty compliant uh different components of of membrane     
32:09     
different things going on in the cell but also you want them to be super stable esecally You have uh sheets of     
32:16     
cells and those cell those sheets also need to be pretty stable and um they     
32:22     
need to be able to uh change their shape and change their orientation with respect to cell migration and repair of     
32:30     
the sheet and things like that which is also something that they're interested in in in biio robotics is this ability     
32:38     
to repair for the robot to repair itself and they don't call the sort of the body     
32:43     
of the robot a lot of skin, but basically that's what they're aiming for. So, it's definitely a place to look     
32:51     
for mathematical models and for techniques um because they're kind of going in the same direction, although I     
32:57     
don't know if their mathematics are kind of suitable for cell biology. Um they     
33:03     
may have, you know, specific imperatives to robotics that they they sort of have     
33:08     
there. Okay, so this is um you know a little bit more about the math here. So when we     
33:17     
do we talk about dynamic structures we consider a matrix of positions P that's     
33:22     
matrix IFJ any kind of J relationship as a matrix we have matrix of positions and     
33:29     
those positions are you know characterize a static shape or a static tenseity structure or Canada 10segrity     
33:37     
structure and what we're going to do is we're going to perturb those structures of the motion T.     
33:43     
So if we have our matrix of positions, we perturb it with a specific external     
33:50     
motion. Say we smack it with a hammer or we kind of shift it, you know, in some     
33:55     
way. We introduce like water flow or something, liquid flows. Then we have     
34:00     
motion T which produces a new configuration P prime. So basically we     
34:05     
have this matrix of positions P. introduces perturbation motion T and     
34:11     
that produces a new configuration P prime or maybe some of the positions are displaced.     
34:17     
So the the sort of the point is that if P equals P prime or sometimes you could     
34:25     
say equivalent which is if you add another bar to this uh symbol if P is     
34:30     
equivalent to P prime or P is equal to P prime basically if there's no effect of the motion or if the effect of the     
34:38     
motion is uh basically turns the P prime     
34:44     
into an equivalent um an equivalent topology. So under rotation you have     
34:51     
things that are basically equivalent. Um if they move so you might have like the     
34:56     
kite that rotates 90 degrees it's still the points are not in the same position     
35:02     
but they have the same relationship point. If that equality holds then you have see     
35:10     
these soft modes and the soft modes relate to null vectors in the matrix. So     
35:16     
we're going to be taking vectors from this matrix and we're going to be evaluating them. So basically if you     
35:22     
take them I'll show you a graphic of this but if you take different slices out of this matrix you can characterize     
35:29     
those using IGEN vectors those vectors can tell you things about the dynamics     
35:35     
of the structure that are you know informative to the the mechanics. Now if     
35:42     
P is not equivalent to P prime or not equal to P prime     
35:48     
then changes require a new shape to be stable. So basically when we perturb P     
35:53     
we're getting P prime and we have to evaluate P prime. If P prime is equal to P in terms of its stability then you     
36:01     
have these soft modes which means that you have new modes that open up and and     
36:06     
preserve the circle structural stability. If P does not equal P prime in terms of its uh properties, then you     
36:15     
need a whole new shape to be stable. Basically, it breaks the structure and collapses. So that's how they're     
36:20     
thinking about this. Now in three-dimensional space, a structure will collapse unless anchored at fixed     
36:27     
points. And we have these different low, you know, we don't want to work in highdimensional space because it's very     
36:33     
hard to to solve these things. We want to have low dimensional examples to demonstrate the calculations that can     
36:40     
also apply to freestanding stable tense segments. Um tense segreies will also change shape     
36:48     
dramatically. Yeah. So they won't necessarily collapse. They'll just simply change shape.     
36:53     
Okay.     
37:03     
Now, this is like if if it's a stable integrity or if it's like just     
37:09     
responding to forces like     
37:14     
I mean like I guess the point here is that um and I don't know if the language is is correct on this but like     
37:22     
um you can have you know, a drastic change in shape and still be stable or do you have a drastic     
37:29     
change in shape that makes it basically nonfunctional but that's what the result     
37:36     
of the forcing? Is that clear?     
37:44     
Yeah. Anyways, I don't Yeah. So yeah, that I may have to dig more into     
37:49     
that and see what they're uh I have I have an example well that I     
37:55     
found for my thesis of something that was sort of basically round and then     
38:00     
collapsed into kind of a bowl shape. Okay, so there are examples and there's Yeah,     
38:08     
I think Dick had a bunch of them too. He was fascinated     
38:14     
by them. So yeah, some examples. So in biological terms, if we had a     
38:22     
sphere that collapsed into a hole, would that still be considered um like a     
38:28     
stable structure or would that just be like uh     
38:34     
using the term collapse kind of globally here, but like would that be considered the same? Would that be considered a     
38:40     
function or is that like just kind of Well, that could be a function that     
38:46     
could be um useful in a biological system.     
38:55     
All right. I'm just taking some     
39:02     
Yeah. Well, then it has has two forms that are are essentially stable and     
39:10     
it'll it'll switch between the two.     
39:15     
So, we have by stability. Yeah.     
39:20     
Yeah, that's good. So, yeah, that's that's a little bit about like how they think about these     
39:27     
kind of changes. Um so this is I was     
39:32     
talking about with IGEN vectors. So you have these force vectors in the matrix. You have these components that are     
39:38     
interacting and you have you know basically it's a force calculation minimizing these these numbers. You're     
39:45     
also able to get vectors which describe the modes. So you can have force factors     
39:50     
which either zero or non zero. Um, and you know, it's just different sort of     
39:57     
orientations of the matrix. So, you might have something that's like a diagonal or you might have something     
40:03     
that is up or down like vertical or horizontal across the matrix. And those     
40:08     
are the force vectors. And so, it's just describing different orientations of forces throughout the structure. And we     
40:16     
can calculate the forces for that. And then we can say things about the structure. Um and so you can see that     
40:23     
you have a lot of potential force vectors, right? A lot of different ways to describe forces on that structure. So     
40:31     
that and the larger the matrices, you know, um the more force vectors you     
40:36     
have and then you know optimizing those to zero or non zero is is a you know a     
40:44     
harder problem. Uh the last slide I want to talk about are these indeterminacies. So 10     
40:51     
segities are indeterminate and citizens discover that makes it hard to simulate in say like a standard     
40:59     
multifysics software. Um and so this is just a property of tensgities. You have     
41:06     
static and kinematic indeterminencies. So static indeterminencies are these     
41:11     
membrane reaction forces that are subject to external nodes that cannot you be uniquely determined and static     
41:19     
indeterminacies are related to pre-stresses or allow for pre-stresses     
41:24     
whereas kinematic indeterminacies uh again you know static is where you have the static shape and you have these     
41:31     
indeterminacies in that then you have kinematic indeterminacies which are when the thing is under translation rotation     
41:39     
And this is where we have nodal motion that keeps lengths of all equivalent edges the same. Um, and then this allows     
41:47     
for movement around axis. So this allows for translation. Um, so that's as far as I've gotten into     
41:54     
this. And I know that this doesn't Yeah. Sorry. I have a table about the static     
42:02     
and um kinematic uh indeterminant     
42:08     
um status and it it has to do with u     
42:13     
um how many um rods are connected to each other.     
42:19     
Okay. So I I have I have a a table     
42:25     
I'll get it to you. It's um Gan's book on 10 segrates     
42:36     
and In living systems you will get two rods     
42:41     
connected to each other like two uh     
42:46     
yeah microtubial structures connected to each other. So it's probably     
42:52     
indeterminate both kinetically and uh dynamically indeterminate.     
42:59     
Indeterminate kinematically indep     
43:15     
work really well for biological systems. Yeah.     
43:22     
So it's stability versus or not versus but it's stability and     
43:29     
or or function. So it's like     
43:34     
yeah it's like function. That's where I was that's when I sorry that's when I was explaining that if you     
43:42     
have two rods connected together they act as a double pendulum. And if     
43:48     
you swing a double pendulum, it's a it's a chaotic system. All right. Yeah.     
43:54     
So therefore, it's indeterminate. That's that's where that comes in.     
44:00     
Yeah.     
44:12     
Of     
44:18     
course, there's a whole mathematics of chaos which actually I should bring up a little bit because that's like kind of     
44:24     
maybe relevant here. Yeah.     
44:30     
So, they want me to use structural engineering to figure out a chaotic system.     
44:37     
Well, this is why I was having trouble like I um I there's a what is it? If     
44:45     
you're mechanical engineer, if it's if it doesn't move, it's broken. If you're     
44:52     
a structural engineer or a civil engineer, if it moves, it's broken. So, I have a     
45:01     
structure that moves. So, I'm in trouble. It's kind of obvious.     
45:08     
That's good.     
45:15     
Yeah. And it takes an electrical to get a wound up in such a ridiculous system.     
45:24     
Yeah. That's what     
45:32     
anyway. Yeah. All right. Well, that's good. All right.     
45:38     
So, that's uh Do you have anything more to add, Susan, on     
45:43     
papers? Well, there's a K factor that you need to look into, and it's not the one that     
45:51     
Gan shows. There's different K factors. Anyway, it the K factor that is the     
45:58     
difference between the elasticity and area of the cables and the elasticity     
46:05     
and area of the rods is an important factor     
46:11     
because I can adjust my model to     
46:16     
uh different materials depending on the difference between those the elasticity     
46:23     
of those two things. So it was able to match skin that was able to match     
46:29     
single cells that came from uh heart material     
46:36     
by adjusting that that K factor. So that was that was very     
46:42     
important is not immediately obvious by reading the literature.     
46:49     
Yeah, it I that was very intriguing. Yeah.     
46:56     
All right. Uh, so yeah, that's I think that's enough for that. Um, I did want to give Sheras time to talk about the     
47:04     
things on Oh, could you send me the slides? Maybe I can could add a couple of of slides to     
47:13     
it or we'll do a Yeah, that'd be good. I'll I'll send it to you     
47:20     
because you've covered different things than than I did. So, yeah. Yeah.     
47:26     
Just kind of like that's what I want to add or I want to like keep adding to it and kind of figure out where the     
47:34     
Yeah, are you there?     
47:41     
Yeah, I'm there. Yeah, you go ahead and yeah, if you want to share your screen or whatever you     
47:47     
want. Um um I like uh I just wrote some like     
47:54     
text like what doubts I had. I didn't uh like do any coding experiments as such     
47:59     
like I had some mathematical doubts as to what we can do. So I basically went to the devoteg uh repository which was a     
48:06     
project for last year and I understood what we are doing. So basically what I understood is that u um there's this     
48:12     
worm called C elegance through which uh we we have its data for lineage and yeah     
48:19     
lineage and connectto so we are predicting the links in the future links in the lineage u by modeling it as a     
48:25     
temporal graph which is like real time graph changing like new nodes are added so that's what I understood and I understood like how is the message     
48:31     
computation done like time coding done GU based memory model and graph attention layer yeah so my questions     
48:37     
were At the first question is that we were um the graph attention layer which is     
48:43     
being used is basically using a top of the shelf pyarch layer like there's a pyarch module which has attention layers     
48:50     
in it. So like transformer conf specific we are using that so is that the most     
48:55     
optimal way to do it can be like the way physics inspired neural networks are there like say they encode some physics     
49:02     
in the network say like energy is constant like it can't change. So can we also get do some custom um attention     
49:09     
layer in which we encode some biology like some basic rules of biology in it through which we can get a better output     
49:15     
like what are your views on this like I'm not that well aware about things so I just thought that can this be one of     
49:21     
the option to do in future maybe yeah I think so like yeah we're just kind of talking about that where you     
49:28     
have to have you know specific or specific things that you discover about the system. So     
49:35     
like you know um yeah I think we can definitely customize the attention layer. Um and there are a lot of things     
49:43     
like if we want to be very specific to what's happening and see elegance development because the lineage tree is     
49:49     
not a full description. It just tells you how cells divide and maybe what their location is in and like the     
49:57     
anterior posterior axis. We have positional data, but we don't, you know,     
50:02     
we're not describing everything. We could describe other aspects of development, you know, in the lineage     
50:08     
tree, what's going on there. So, yeah, we could do that. We could customize it with, you know, different um components.     
50:16     
Uh be like, you know, molecular biology, it could be the physics of the embryo,     
50:22     
things like that. Um I'm not sure how um Giadratha defined     
50:29     
everything in the attention letter. So I mean that like I guess best way to do that is to kind of point out what what's     
50:36     
going on there and like how you plan to modify it. Um how that would improve uh prediction     
50:45     
perhaps. Okay. One just knife thing which I came     
50:50     
across on the internet like please let me correct me in the biology part because I'm just learning it is that     
50:56     
like say there's embryo as of now the like what it does is like it for the     
51:01     
biology part which I'm asking the negative sampling the negative sampling is random like for the parts which are     
51:08     
not per link they just randomly sampling and taking anything but what I encountered is like say there are two     
51:14     
cells there is a embryo in which organs are going to develop from so like cells are going divide and get into some     
51:20     
organs. Now say some cell is near the gut like it's supposed to be the gut and whereas some other cell is in the other     
51:26     
end of embryo which is supposed to be some other type of organ. So say cell A and cell B we have two like cell A and     
51:33     
cell B. So like cell A cannot give birth in the later stage to cell B because     
51:38     
it's in other stage and it's supposed to be some other type of organ but whereas in negative sampling what we are doing is that we're just randomly selecting we     
51:44     
are not getting hard hard negative. So what I thought is like this is making it easier for the model to get a good     
51:51     
accuracy because if say it learns that the the farther the coordinate is the     
51:56     
more unlikely it is to be like one cell to be linked to another. So like is this     
52:01     
a thing and can we like somehow like get some harder negatives and make model to     
52:08     
learn some more niche web biology stuff rather than just learning that okay if it is far then just like uh uh uh don't     
52:15     
link it and making the accuracy higher like this is what I think that this thing is making accuracy higher because     
52:21     
we are getting like easier negatives are being constructed and some harder negatives can be constructed is what I'm     
52:26     
thinking what are your views on this yeah so that's that's good I Like so in     
52:32     
graph theory you know we usually use uh random graphs to describe kind of like the null condition and then you know we     
52:40     
usually have structure graphs that we compare it to. So I mean definitely we want to be able to account for structure     
52:46     
like in the early embryo there isn't a lot of structure so it doesn't necessarily     
52:52     
but eventually you can improve the model I think by doing that. Now you know this is again how are we going to introduce     
53:00     
that constraint with the with the data that we have. Uh there are a couple ways you can do that. Uh one is by looking at     
53:08     
sort of the relative position of the cell. Like so if it's in a place that we expect muscle uh we might introduce a     
53:16     
constraint for that. if it's in a place that is uh like uh like if you look down     
53:23     
the lineage tree eventually these things differentiate there's certain sublineages that yield certain types of     
53:30     
cells like the C lineage and the D lineage they're very specific but the AB     
53:35     
lineage of course is more general but we know that like if you get down in terms     
53:40     
of granularity that certain parts of the lineage tree are going to yield certain     
53:46     
cells so we have those kind constraints kind of built in at least in terms of C elegance biology as to what things are     
53:53     
going to happen um for vertebrates don't forget um the     
53:59     
neural crest cells because they move they're mezzenine they're crawling cells     
54:05     
and they they they'll move the whole length of the backbone so you have to watch out for those in in     
54:12     
a vertebrae they will they really do move.     
54:19     
Yeah. So there are all sorts of constraints we can introduce. I think in C elegance though I think it's probably     
54:26     
the easiest ways to look at the lineage and kind of think about where maybe the positions of the cells and kind of think     
54:32     
about what we should expect for those places. Um it would have to talk about     
54:37     
that, you know, we'd have to kind of come up with a scheme for it. Uh, and     
54:43     
then Susan's talking about like if you were to apply this to like vertebrate     
54:48     
systems where you have like different germ layers and then you have like different things going on that that     
54:55     
emerge from those germ layers and there's all sorts of migration and formation of structures. And so there's     
55:02     
in C elegance you get structures but those structures are more deterministic     
55:08     
in the sense that we know kind of what the cells are going to become. But you know it's like what is and I     
55:14     
don't think people know exactly what happens in the regions where you get these cells. I guess you know because     
55:20     
they're deterministic it doesn't matter so much but you can perturb the system in different ways and like get things     
55:27     
that are nonfunctional. So that's interesting and you know we I I don't want to get too deep into the     
55:32     
technology here but we can deal with those kind we can kind of come up with a     
55:37     
scheme that deals with that and it would be make I think the the uh TG approach     
55:42     
much more interesting right yeah understand um and yeah one     
55:48     
more thing one more I had is that uh I see that the edges one of the part of     
55:53     
the edges were the exact coordinates like the XYZ coordinates of the parent cell was one of the parameters which was inputed. But then it occurred to me that     
56:00     
what if like is this uh rotation invariant? Like say the embryo rotates by 70° 90° but we are not inputting     
56:08     
relative distances but rather we are inputting exact coordinates. So does exact coordin does ex input exact     
56:15     
coordinates not make it like uh rotation variant like what if the the embryo     
56:20     
embryo does shifts and all right. So how can we make it rotation invariant and is it actually useful to make it rotation     
56:26     
invariant? Is it an issue? Uh so you know a word about like where     
56:32     
the data come from. So it comes from cell uh tracking data. So like when they     
56:38     
collect the data from microscopy example um you know they'll have like a a sort     
56:45     
of a coordinate system. They'll track the cells cells are certain distance from one another or they're in a certain     
56:52     
position in the slide. And the data sets that we have to work from usually get     
56:57     
normalized in some way. So you normalize the thing to the center point kind of     
57:02     
average out over a bunch of observations and you get a a number which is somewhat     
57:08     
useful. If you construct a point cloud you can see where the points are. So     
57:13     
there are advantages and disadvantages to that. One of which is it doesn't really do a very good job accounting for     
57:20     
cell migration. in elegance that's not such a big deal because there's kind of like there's always this sort of a     
57:26     
similar place where the cells end up. So if you were in a system where you had     
57:31     
like in a mamalian system that might not be so useful because you have cells that     
57:36     
migrate and are subject to signals like regulative signals that mean that you     
57:42     
know if you're in a it's not a deterministic position. So that's a that's a that's a thing that we kind of     
57:48     
I mean kind of a best way to do it sort of thing we come up with now you know in     
57:54     
terms of rotating it I mean it's rotation and variant um I guess in the sense that you know     
58:02     
you can yeah I don't know to answer that     
58:09     
um but yeah it's like you mean it preserves a structure as you rotate     
58:16     
that you're getting at or I mean what were you thinking about in terms of     
58:22     
what did you want to do with the model I guess?     
58:28     
Yeah. So like basically my thought was that the same like what if like say later data whichever data we get like     
58:34     
say which we want to predict actually use model somewhere and what if like that uh the coordinates exact which we     
58:41     
are implementing that are not the way we expect it to be centered right     
58:47     
yeah so like would it affect the results um yeah I mean it probably would I'm not     
58:55     
really sure what the answer is there Um yeah, you'd have to play around and see     
59:02     
uh what what you get. Right. Right.     
59:08     
Um okay. And one last thing like uh this this all prediction was for lineage prediction for connectto like I I     
59:15     
understood that we were doing the visualizations using the devograph library. The various types of visualization and analysis was done for     
59:23     
lineage and connect. Prediction was done only for lineage part. So is there any     
59:29     
like uh like can we do any prediction for act part as well and like what can     
59:35     
we do there? Is there any avenue? Well we have the lineage tree we have we     
59:41     
know what cells are going to become neurons so we can trace through the lineage tree find the end points the     
59:48     
cells are neurons and then we have those positions just kind of by default.     
59:54     
um we we don't I mean the conneto data is a little bit different in that it's like you know we're looking at the     
1:00:00     
connections between cells um in different ways there different types of conneto but yeah I mean we can combine     
1:00:08     
the lineage tree and the conneto we've done that before uh we have some papers on it but like you know there are     
1:00:14     
different ways you can do that too because it's interesting how those things kind of emerge as the cells     
1:00:21     
differentiate they'll form connections they'll kind of be in place and so we     
1:00:26     
can yeah we can talk about that more but suffice it to say you know there are connections that we can do we can use     
1:00:32     
but I'm not really sure again we'd have to decide what what's interesting there     
1:00:39     
yeah sure yeah okay yeah thanks for giving time then last thing I had to ask like uh     
1:00:44     
what would you recommend me for next week to read up and like uh um what should I go into and what should I read     
1:00:50     
up to understand more about this topic and what are the aims for this year so that I'll be very aligned with the aims. Yeah. So, um Jadratha and I are working     
1:00:58     
on a paper on this. So, I can share it with you. I guess the current state     
1:01:05     
um and then we have some other things that we're uh doing. I guess one of the aims is to improve upon the model. So,     
1:01:13     
you know, we got a cert to a certain stopping point last year and we're going to keep improving it. And I guess     
1:01:20     
Jadrotha has created some issues hopefully um in the repository you could     
1:01:26     
look at those uh you could also get in touch with Jratha you know and that's     
1:01:32     
will I find him on the slack channel I think he's in Slack or he might not be     
1:01:38     
open Slack if I recall because he couldn't get in um but I'll put you in touch with him     
1:01:45     
sure sure yeah um okay cool um yeah let me know     
1:01:51     
put in touch I also to look into this and excited to work on this thing. Great. Yeah, glad to hear you're     
1:01:58     
enthusiastic. Yeah, thank you for your time. Yeah,     
1:02:06     
Susan, you wanted to say something? Yeah, I I I look forward to adding a     
1:02:11     
couple of slides to what you've made there. um     
1:02:17     
because I h I have them all already prepared or they were part of my thesis. So     
1:02:23     
Oh, that's great. Yeah. So I could just add a couple of slides that will that go with the     
1:02:31     
instabilities. Great. Maybe maybe I should explain the double     
1:02:37     
pendulum too while I'm at it. Yeah, that'd be good.     
1:02:46     
All right, that's great.     
1:02:52     
So, we're done for today. Um, so have a good week and talk to you next week.     
1:03:00     
Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.     
1:03:07     
So one thing I mentioned in the tensegrity slides is that tense     
1:03:12     
are useful for soft robotic design and in the field of soft robotics more generally. And so this is one of the     
1:03:19     
papers that um they had I guess an review article in the journal soft     
1:03:25     
robotics from 2018 and this is an article called adaptive     
1:03:30     
and resilient soft segments. So this is from John Reeel and John     
1:03:36     
Piptis Marray. Uh they they talk a little bit about how they apply tense to     
1:03:43     
these kind of soft robots which are adaptive and resilient.     
1:03:49     
So the abstract reads living organisms intertwine soft and hard materials. So     
1:03:55     
soft biological materials are muscle, hard biological materials are bone. And     
1:04:01     
of course you're intertwining them into systems. So muscle is over bone and it     
1:04:06     
enables both rigidity and movement. This gives living organisms an intrinsic     
1:04:14     
flexibility and resiliency often lacking conventional rigid robots.     
1:04:21     
And so the emerging field of soft robotics seeks to harness these same properties to create resilient machines.     
1:04:28     
The nature of soft materials however presents considerable challenges to aspects of design, construction and     
1:04:35     
control. And up until now the vast majority of gates for soft robotics have     
1:04:41     
been handd designed through empirical trial and error. So you know the whole idea of soft robotics is we want to     
1:04:48     
create these structures that are maybe more biological. We want to understand the design     
1:04:53     
principles behind building these things. Uh which of course it could be that you     
1:04:59     
know you may need to use an evolutionary approach to sort of build structures um     
1:05:05     
much like biology does or you could figure out kind of key aspects of     
1:05:11     
stability and structural stability and structural relations between these components that you know are sort of     
1:05:19     
optimal but also flexible enough to operate in different ways. So what     
1:05:24     
they're going to be doing is they're going to be thinking about optimization but they're also thinking about the sort     
1:05:29     
of form finding. This article describes an easy to     
1:05:35     
assemble 10 segrity based soft robot capable of highly dynamic locomotive     
1:05:40     
gates and demonstrating structural and behavioral resilience in the face of physical damage. Enabling this is the     
1:05:48     
use of a machine learning algorithm able to discover effective gates with a minimal number of physical trials.     
1:05:56     
So they want to be able to get something that can walk um quickly. You know, you     
1:06:01     
don't want to have to train it very much. Um you also want something that is structural and behaviorally resilient.     
1:06:08     
So you want something that can walk under a wide variety of conditions, something that can be structurally     
1:06:14     
stable under the same kinds of conditions. These results on further credence to     
1:06:20     
soft robotic approaches that seek to harness the interaction of complex material dynamics that generate a wealth     
1:06:27     
of dynamic behaviors. Okay. So,     
1:06:37     
so this basic problem of machines not being like animals in terms of how     
1:06:44     
they can exhibit resilience. Um, so this is a common problem I think     
1:06:49     
with artificial systems or chain systems is that they just don't have the sort of     
1:06:55     
uh resilience and variety that living systems do. Um in nature this suppleness     
1:07:02     
and they define suppleness as sort of these soft the combination of soft tissues and rigid skeletons.     
1:07:09     
This suppleness leads to several compelling behaviors that exploit the dynamics of soft systems. Octopi are     
1:07:16     
famous for this muscular hydrostat which is where they have an arm that is     
1:07:21     
consists of muscle ganglia. Each of the muscle ganglia are controlled independently. So they have a large     
1:07:27     
number of degrees of freedom so that that arm can grasp things, can wrap     
1:07:32     
around things, manipulate. It's a very different mode from what we do as humans     
1:07:38     
in terms of reaching and grasping. And it has a very similar function, but it's very different in terms of its     
1:07:43     
structure. And so they're able to perform these adaptive behaviors with the softbodied mechanical system.     
1:07:53     
Jellyfish exploit their inherent elasticity to passively recover energy during swimming.     
1:07:59     
Manduca sex which is a moth which has a caterpillar life history phase have a     
1:08:06     
midgut which acts like a visceral locomatory piston. So we can actually take some of the structures in biology     
1:08:12     
and characterize them as these machines. In this case, the mid gut acts like a visceral loatory piston, sliding forward     
1:08:20     
ahead of the surrounding soft tissues, shifting the animal center mass forward well before any visible exterior change.     
1:08:27     
And this is the way this caterpillar uh moves. So they move their midbody     
1:08:32     
forward and the rest of their body follows and that's their form of motion during this period of their life     
1:08:38     
history. Taking inspiration from the natural world, the field of soft robotics seeks     
1:08:45     
to address some of the constraints from conventional rigid robots through the use of compliant, flexible and elastic     
1:08:52     
materials. So compliant materials are things that give in response to forces.     
1:08:58     
They don't shatter. They don't kind of lose their function. They they kind of     
1:09:03     
blend in with the forces of the world. They're they're flexible. They're     
1:09:09     
elastic. Um, trimmer for instance constructs off robots from silicon     
1:09:14     
rubber which is a sort of compliant material using shape memory alloy micro     
1:09:20     
coil actuation which can solely crawl in a controlled manner or roll in an     
1:09:25     
uncontrolled ballistic manner. So they have different types of behaviors slow movements that are more controlled or     
1:09:33     
rolling that's more uncontrolled. Similarly, researched by Whitesides that all use pneumatic inflation to produce     
1:09:39     
slow dynamically stable crawling motions as well as fast but less controlled tentacle-l like grippers, combustion     
1:09:46     
driven jumpers and self-contained microffluic octabots.     
1:09:52     
Despite these their advantages, soft material robots are difficult to control by conventional means. They are by their     
1:09:58     
very nature highdimensional dynamic systems with an essential infinite number of degrees of freedom. The     
1:10:05     
elasticity and deformability that provide their appeal come at the cost of resonances and tight dynamic coupling     
1:10:11     
between components. Properties that are often avoided or at     
1:10:17     
least suppressed in conventional engineering approaches to robotic design.     
1:10:22     
This complexity precludes the use of many of the traditional kinematic and inverse dynamics approaches to robotic     
1:10:29     
control. Up until now, the locomotive gates of most soft robots have been developed by     
1:10:35     
hand for impair trial and error. This process can be both challenging and timeconuming, particularly when seeking     
1:10:42     
to fully exploit the dynamical complexity of soft mechanisms.     
1:10:50     
So this is where they introduce tense. Tensities are relatively simple mechanical systems consisting of a     
1:10:57     
number of rigid elements which they call struts joined at their end points by tensile elements which are these cables     
1:11:04     
or springs and kept stable through the synergistic interplay of pre-stress forces. So they get into this in figure     
1:11:11     
one. We'll look at that in a minute. Beyond engineering, properties of tenseity have been demonstrated at all     
1:11:19     
scales of the natural world, ranging from the networks in the human hand to     
1:11:25     
the mechano transduction of living cells. And then so at every size tense     
1:11:30     
structures exhibit two interesting features. The first is they have an impressive strength strength to weight ratio and     
1:11:38     
their structure robust and stable in the face of deformation. So the first is that they have this impressive strength     
1:11:45     
to weight ratio. So it means that you can stress them with a lot and you know very lightweight structures have a very     
1:11:53     
large ability to be loaded and to be stable under that load. And then we have     
1:11:58     
these structural robust and stable structures that are basically um     
1:12:05     
invariant in the face of deformation. So you can form something quite a bit     
1:12:10     
and they respond by maintaining their shape. You can also load them quite a     
1:12:16     
bit and they are still functional. So this speaks to biological function that     
1:12:22     
we want structures that maintain their function under these conditions.     
1:12:28     
Moreover, under unlike many other soft robots, tenseity structures are inherently modular consist consisting of     
1:12:36     
only struts and springs. There are therefore relatively easy to construct. They're simple enough to be     
1:12:43     
baby toys and featured in books for children's activities whereas complex enough to serve as a basis for the next     
1:12:49     
generation of NASA's planetary rovers. The most common control method for 10     
1:12:55     
segity robots then is to slowly change the lengths of the struts in her cables     
1:13:01     
causing largecale quazi static rather than dynamic structural deformationations     
1:13:07     
which in turn make the robot move through its tumbling and rolling. So they basically use     
1:13:13     
sort of perturbations to move the robot. So they're able to do these different modes of movement. they can do these     
1:13:19     
uncontrolled movements or these controlled movements. And I find it interesting that they kind     
1:13:25     
of focus on this because this is something that we often use in in other     
1:13:32     
types of robotics. We often use neural control or we often assume that neural     
1:13:38     
control is necessary. And one of the lessons from embodied robotics is that the body actually plays     
1:13:45     
a role in some of that control as well. That's what we see here. We have this body shaped control that basically the     
1:13:52     
body is is responding to what are essentially stochastic uh     
1:13:59     
perturbations and it's producing these uh behavioral modes which are you know     
1:14:05     
actually get get the job done basically. And so this is a soft hand segregity     
1:14:14     
structures and then they show their robot that they've built. So in a we have this uh mechanical structure which     
1:14:22     
is you know purely mechanical. There's no soft aspect to this no biological aspect. These are bridge constructions.     
1:14:29     
So this is one aspect of a tenseity arch. This is another aspect of a tense     
1:14:35     
structure bridge building. They have to maintain loads um and under you know and as well as     
1:14:41     
stability under environmental forces like wind and even being struck by     
1:14:47     
something. Um C is where you see 10 segreg     
1:14:53     
specifically is mechanuction in living cells. So you have these forces that are     
1:15:00     
transduced into the cell from other cells around it and the cells respond in     
1:15:05     
kind. And then of course we have our our robots that they have here. So D is a     
1:15:14     
robot that's based on carbon struts and springs actuated by three vibrators     
1:15:20     
glued to three other struts. This frequency is automatically tuned by a trial and error ringing out. So there is     
1:15:26     
some neural control in this but it's tuned. It's not generated denovo by the     
1:15:32     
um by the el. And then E is thanks to the     
1:15:37     
tensegrity structure and the compliance of the springs our robot will keep its integrity when deformed and spring back     
1:15:44     
to its initial. So here you see that this robot if you push it with some     
1:15:50     
stochastic perturbation. It can move in these different modes. You can tune that mode through some sort of neural     
1:15:56     
control. But then of course the idea is that you can deform the thing severely     
1:16:03     
in pop back to its original shape. So it always remembers its old shape has     
1:16:11     
this sort of morphological memory and then of course it's able to still     
1:16:16     
produce behaviors that are produced by the morphology.     
1:16:23     
So one of the things about this paper is they talk a little bit about dynamical methods of tensity robot control. So     
1:16:29     
that relates to the things we're talking about with dynamical uh modes in tenseity structures more     
1:16:35     
generally. So researchers have begun investigating this um bliss at all have     
1:16:42     
used central pattern generators or CPGs to produce resonant entrainment of simulated non-mobile tgrity structures.     
1:16:50     
So CPGs are like these oscillators that are produced if you look at insect     
1:16:57     
uh gate or insect movement where they have a bunch of legs and they're centered upon a um a bunch of bundle of     
1:17:05     
neurons in their midline um in their noticord. They have these     
1:17:13     
different neurons that produce networks of neurons that produce oscillations locally. They drive the legs and that     
1:17:20     
drives movement. So you can use central pattern generators very in very     
1:17:25     
interesting ways to produce movement behaviors. And if you have a bunch of central pattern generators arrayed     
1:17:32     
across like a a noticord like you have in insects, you then have you can     
1:17:39     
entrain those central pattern generators to produce pattern movement. So insects     
1:17:44     
will walk forward or walk backwards and this depends on sort of the way in which     
1:17:50     
the oscillation is being produced in a single c central pattern generator and then how the central pattern generators     
1:17:56     
for each pair of legs are entrained. So there's very interesting things you can do with stochastic or quai     
1:18:04     
stochastic systems with respect to bodies especially with tenseity structures.     
1:18:10     
Merlets at all use CPGs to produce goal directed behavior in simulated tensity     
1:18:15     
spinebased robots. These efforts however are valuable were all produced in simulated environments.     
1:18:22     
So we need to have real world robotic examples. As as mirrors point out the dynamic     
1:18:28     
behavior of tense is highly dependent upon the substrate they interact with. So the substrate and this is the same     
1:18:35     
thing in cellular systems. You know, if we talk about our cell sheet, our sheet     
1:18:41     
of epithelial cells, we have a substrate which the cells adhere to and that     
1:18:46     
substrate affects the behavior because as we talked about these tensity systems     
1:18:52     
have to be anchored on a substrate in order to be to exhibit what this tenses     
1:18:57     
in the first place. In this case, we have different substrates that you know are where these     
1:19:06     
robots can function and so depending on that substrate is going to give you um     
1:19:11     
you know a certain t motive of dynamics. So     
1:19:17     
you know we can't necessarily assume that something we produce simulo will transfer to the real world.     
1:19:24     
So this is of course in evolutionary robotics this is known as the reality gap.     
1:19:29     
More recently, Bowman Zimmerman developed a tensity inspired robot actuated by a single oscillating     
1:19:35     
electrode. And so this was compellingly able to change between forward and backward     
1:19:41     
local motion by changing the frequency of the oscillator. Vibration has been     
1:19:47     
proposed as a means of controlling much softer robots as well.     
1:19:54     
So they not only need to find the tensities, the right shapes, but they also need to find the right vibrational     
1:20:01     
frequencies to produce some of these behaviors. They're trying to do this kind of form finding and behavior     
1:20:07     
finding. And again this is a hard problem that involves a lot of you know could involve a lot of computational     
1:20:15     
uh power but you know we want to be able to find we want to be able to add constraints and find the right answer     
1:20:22     
for our system. So um in this case what they describe is this improvement upon     
1:20:29     
earlier time inensive methods by employing a basian optimization algorithm     
1:20:35     
which allows us to find maximum of a performance function as few trials as possible. So they're training this 10     
1:20:43     
segity structure to do these different behaviors. They want to find something that's very efficient in terms of     
1:20:48     
learning or at least in terms of getting the getting coordinated on its     
1:20:54     
substrate. And so what's interesting about basian optimization as opposed to some other     
1:20:59     
form of optimization probabilistic optimization for example is that basian optimization starts with     
1:21:06     
a constant prior for the expected observation. So we usually have a prior which is a     
1:21:13     
distribution of maybe like this case an expected speed. And we use that prior to     
1:21:20     
sort of uh figure out, you know, if we observe a bunch of different variants,     
1:21:26     
which of those variants match our prior. And then we can have a posterior observ     
1:21:32     
or posterior evaluation of that observation. That lead to updating the prior and we can run through that space     
1:21:40     
and eventually find the optimal solutions to the problem.     
1:21:47     
And so uh we have different ways we can initialize the     
1:21:52     
model. We have um we you know we have a few randomly chosen trials. Uh they say     
1:21:58     
for this robot however common sense along with preliminary modeling suggested speeds near the motor maximums     
1:22:04     
are more likely to produce successful gates and then near zero motor speeds are not expected to make the robot move.     
1:22:12     
This insight was substantiated in preliminary experiments. Many effective gates were produced by high motor speeds     
1:22:19     
both forwards and backwards. Therefore, to speed up learning, we use a nonlinear prior model that includes     
1:22:27     
the following points. Number one is that if the three motor speeds are close to zero, then we should expect a locom     
1:22:35     
motion speed close to zero. And then two, if all the motors are close to full speed in any direction, we should expect     
1:22:42     
the maximum motions. And so we don't need to seed um our     
1:22:49     
algorithm with any random sample points. We can you know start with our prior and     
1:22:54     
work from there and basian optimization. So that was uh sort of thinking about     
1:22:59     
the control policy for movement. But of course, as we go back to this idea of     
1:23:05     
form finding, we're basically trying to search through a very large search space to find optimal solutions.     
1:23:13     
So some of that has to do with, you know, kind of having the right algorithm, having the right criterion,     
1:23:19     
but some of this also is where the, you know, we to get to this behavioral     
1:23:25     
policy, we need to address the design of the structure. And so there's some     
1:23:31     
initial form finding that happens before we move to the defining the control policy.     
1:23:37     
Um in this case we purposely designed the robot so that the search space is as small as possible which in turn makes it     
1:23:45     
more likely for the robot to be able to adapt in a few trials. Put differently     
1:23:50     
one of the main strengths of vibration based locomotion is to make the search problem as simple as possible.     
1:23:57     
Although in principle a variety of optimization techniques such as simulating enealing might be used, there     
1:24:05     
are compelling reasons why our adaptation algorithm is based on basian optimization.     
1:24:10     
Um a couple of those reasons involve it is a principled approach to optimize an unknown cost function and only a few     
1:24:18     
dozen samples are possible. And if we wanted to use simulated analing, we would need to have the     
1:24:25     
statistical properties of the search space where we can actually operate from a large number of samples and define     
1:24:33     
them. So you know in cases where you don't necessarily know the statistics of your search space you can use something     
1:24:40     
like basian optimization over some other alternative like simulated two it can incorporate prior     
1:24:47     
knowledge in a theoretically sound way including trusting real samples more than prior information.     
1:24:54     
uh and so this is you know we don't want to uh you know there are ways you can make basian models kind of less     
1:25:01     
effective um we can do you know direct observations or we can use sort of     
1:25:07     
statistical uh observations and of course world observations are better     
1:25:14     
and then three it takes into account the acquisition noise so basian optimization     
1:25:19     
is the current method of choice for optimizing the hyperparameters of neural networks because evaluating the learning     
1:25:26     
abilities of a neural network is both noisy and time intensive. So basian optimization they're making a case for     
1:25:32     
this. On the downside basian optimization has a relatively high computational cost. So searching very     
1:25:39     
large search spaces that this method is not necessarily going to work out. There's a sort of a costly nonlinear     
1:25:46     
optimizer that's required for this. Um, basian optimization trades data with     
1:25:53     
computation which makes it data efficient but computationally costly. So when we're dealing with these very large     
1:25:59     
search spaces, we need to be able to find the method that searches the search space in the way we need. Sometimes if     
1:26:06     
we're dealing with a tenseity structure that has some sort     
1:26:12     
of behavior associated with it, we might optimize the tenseity structure first.     
1:26:18     
It could be the the static aspects. It could be the dynamic aspects and then     
1:26:24     
optimize the behavior or optimize for static form and then the dynamic form.     
1:26:29     
We can split our problem up in that way. And so most blackbox optimization and direct policy search algorithms such as     
1:26:37     
policy gradients could substitute basian optimization as an adaptation algorithm     
1:26:42     
by directly optimizing the reward instead of first modeling it with a Gaussian process.     
1:26:49     
And so this is just all speaking to how to optimize the space.     
1:26:56     
And so as a final point, this is figure six. This is an untethered version of their 10seg robot. You notice that we     
1:27:03     
have the components here, the springs, the struts and the uh the nodes here and     
1:27:11     
they all kind of are in this configuration. Uh this new robot still under development will allow for more     
1:27:18     
interesting dynamical behaviors such as rolling as well as complex environments.     
1:27:24     
This could in principle allow for completely onboard learning as well. So this is the the structure and again we     
1:27:30     
have the structure needs to be stable statically dynamically and then maybe     
1:27:35     
produce behavioral modes which allow it to do things and this is true of biological um tenseity structures too.     
1:27:44     
We want our tenseity structures ultimately to do things. We want uh them     
1:27:50     
to bear loads. We want them to maybe the cells to migrate in different ways and     
1:27:55     
still be stable. So, we're not just talking about cells. We're talking about cell sheets. We're talking about organs.     
1:28:02     
There all sorts of ted segies in biology.
