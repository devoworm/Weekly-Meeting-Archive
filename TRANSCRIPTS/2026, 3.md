Hello. There you are.     
0:05     
What's going on today? Well, I have tried to add a few slides     
0:12     
to your uh 10segrity um     
0:17     
upload and all the slides got dumped onto one slide. Oh, yeah. I saw     
0:22     
I don't know what I was doing wrong. Oh, well, I I did get the slideshow you     
0:28     
sent me and I put it in. So, they should all be there. Okay. What was I doing?     
0:34     
I don't know. I got one more slide that that I'd like to discuss sometime.     
0:41     
Okay. Yeah. I mean, you could share your screen and show it, too. I mean, I know it's a little hard to navigate the     
0:48     
Well, yeah, I can I can do that. Um, yeah. What you do that now?     
0:54     
Yeah. Why don't we start and you can do that and then I'll go into the rest of it. Okay. Well, I added a few things. This     
1:01     
is this is uh something I liked from Wikipedia     
1:07     
and it it shows the simplest 3D form of     
1:12     
uh tenseity. Yeah. And this is very stable.     
1:17     
I actually was able to put it in a finite element analysis um program and and it works.     
1:26     
All right. Anyways, so there's strings and um     
1:35     
strings which are tension element and um did you call them bars or rods? Rods or     
1:43     
bars are the compression element and they're in green here. Yeah.     
1:51     
And then you had a 2D kite form which is nice for studying um the math and just     
2:01     
as a beginner um study because uh the 3D one is difficult     
2:09     
uh to put in a program but also impossible to do by hand. So     
2:15     
yeah. Yeah. And then I added um     
2:23     
you had this about um whether it's static um determinate or indeterminate.     
2:32     
Um and it has to do with um     
2:38     
the degrees of freedom. So if you're um attach a bar to strings, it it only has     
2:48     
itself that is moving. But if it's got um if it's like this at the side here     
2:58     
where there's two degrees of freedom, if you have two bars connecting to each     
3:03     
other, then you've got um     
3:08     
well, if it's unconstrained, it's a double pendulum. And that's a chaotic system,     
3:16     
but it is constrained by the strings. So     
3:21     
I don't I've got a I had this this is a double pendulum and     
3:29     
it depends on uh the initial state as to     
3:35     
where it moves but it moves all over the place. Okay.     
3:44     
Um what else? Uh okay there's there's kinematic um     
3:52     
it's defined as the number of independent zero energy deformation     
3:58     
modes of a rigid rigid body. Um     
4:04     
and then there's the formula and this is so you can do math with it.     
4:11     
Um and then this is the self stress. So it the embers naturally have a stress     
4:20     
on them. And definition of self stress     
4:26     
um it's the number of independent states of self stress self stress mechanisms I     
4:34     
don't know a structural system with s equals z it     
4:39     
means the structural system is statically determinate     
4:45     
and I have I had the reference over here GAN 2020 computation     
4:51     
modeling of consecuting     
5:00     
the rank. So you can actually get a matrix for this and um so there's these     
5:08     
four classes of tense and they've determined whether they're     
5:15     
statically determinate or indeterminate and kinematically determinant or     
5:20     
indeterminate and you don't go very far before they're     
5:26     
you can't figure them out if they're indeterminant um     
5:35     
uh the math math doesn't work for you anymore like the matrices go off to     
5:41     
infinity. So um that's why they often say that u a     
5:49     
tenseity only has uh strings attached to rods     
5:55     
or rods attached to strings and you don't have two rods attached to each other. And then that that gets back to     
6:02     
the um to the double pendulum idea,     
6:07     
right? So, and then tada, there's another K.     
6:17     
So, this is another K. And if you take the     
6:24     
elasticity and area of the string divided by the area and elasticity of     
6:29     
the bar over each other, you get another K value. And if you play with that um you     
6:39     
can change the slope of of the um stress     
6:44     
strain curve. So that's how I match the stress string     
6:50     
curve of real things like uh skin or a thin layer of cells to um a at 10segrity     
7:01     
um for my thesis. Like I could actually um change the     
7:07     
order of magnitude of the of the graph     
7:14     
by changing these. Really? Yeah.     
7:20     
That was a major discovery. Then I could do my thesis because I could match it to     
7:25     
other people's data. Right. Anyways, um you can see the elasticity     
7:34     
of the bars is 200 GPA which is like steel     
7:39     
and this is according to Dr. Amber and other people.     
7:46     
And the strings are also um fairly um     
7:51     
non well they have a high elasticity so they're fairly stiff and they've got 100     
7:59     
GPA which is uh like steel again.     
8:04     
Yeah. Not quite as high as as the bars but close. And even.5     
8:12     
megapascals is is a lot. So um in a cell the strings are fairly     
8:20     
stiff. Anyway, that's that's what I wanted to show you. If you want to see my thesis presentation, I can show you     
8:27     
how I matched um things to skin and the layer of     
8:33     
cells. You want to see that? Yeah, that'd be good. Yeah. Anyway, so     
8:40     
this is um my thesis and     
8:45     
I started off with my introduction. So this is epithelial     
8:53     
tissue and it has a certain structure. It's different from the interior tissues     
9:00     
which fit together more like bubbles and they're um more of a hexagon, not a     
9:06     
hexagon. um no dough hex     
9:11     
[Music] I know 3D shape.     
9:17     
Yeah. Anyway, um these are more more flat and they um they're attached by their     
9:24     
corners and the bottom of the structure.     
9:32     
And this is a stress strain curve. And this is for skin.     
9:38     
And it starts off kind of disordered and then you pull on it and becomes ordered     
9:45     
and then it breaks here. So this is stra the stress and strain     
9:51     
curve for this. So it under goes a a phase transition then a failure or critical failure I     
9:58     
guess. Yeah. It it has two slopes basically. Has the bottom     
10:05     
slope here and then um this um steeper slope. Yeah, it's a it's um phase     
10:12     
transition and it's got a J curve. Okay. Yeah, this doesn't always happen with tissue.     
10:19     
Sometimes it the curve is flat. Anyways, this this is     
10:25     
showing um the belt that's around the top of epithelial cells and they're not     
10:32     
square. Um occasionally they become square. They're they're very mobile and     
10:40     
they're more or less a hexagon shape as maybe you can see in the far in part C     
10:46     
here. Yeah. But they all have this belt that's around the top.     
10:52     
And it's a tight junction and adherence junction     
10:57     
and they are solidly um attached.     
11:05     
This one shows um the actin and meosin fibers that are part of the belt and     
11:12     
they're actually mobile. I can tighten     
11:17     
and I'm not doing this slideshow properly. Oh well. Um,     
11:25     
and then there's tri junctions. So the cells at the corners are held     
11:32     
together with triunctions and they go into the cell somewhat like they're     
11:39     
they've got a thickness to them and um this is important for the behavior of     
11:46     
this this cell sheet     
11:53     
and then this is my model. So I made a model with a top ring     
12:00     
and with attachments to the the bottom which I I called the     
12:08     
basement membrane and um then I had the tri junctions at the the corners where     
12:17     
it attached and I don't know if you can see this from here but I had posts in here to     
12:25     
hold my model up because I didn't get more than three cells done. I had a lot     
12:31     
of trouble with this. Um I couldn't get it to be stable for a finite element     
12:39     
analysis um program. And the way I did that was I     
12:45     
made um this trijunction in the middle different from the ones that were attached to the posts.     
12:54     
So this is the model build. And this is a a 3D 10segrity showing     
13:01     
this is in tension and compression. And I put these at the the posts to hold     
13:09     
the structure up or pretend to be uh the rest of the cell sheet     
13:16     
since I only had three cells. And this more complex um     
13:25     
trijunction um was used in between the cells in the     
13:30     
middle and that's the only way I could get the thing stand up st in a stable     
13:36     
manner for the finite element analysis program.     
13:42     
So, it was very frustrating to find that I needed this structure in the middle     
13:47     
and the other structure for the sides.     
13:52     
I don't know how how I even discovered it. Yeah. Yeah.     
13:59     
Professors going make it work. But anyways, um, so I this is this is a     
14:07     
hexagon that I I built for the the three layers.     
14:13     
And um then my building blocks were this     
14:19     
this type of a 10segrity for the sides. So then you get a hexagon     
14:27     
with um these the 10 segity sides. And     
14:32     
when I made them opposite to each other, you can see I've got one going this way and another going     
14:41     
that way, then my model worked. If you made them both go the same way,     
14:46     
then the model didn't work. But it showed some interesting properties, right?     
14:52     
Yeah. Yeah. So, and how many countless hours I spent     
14:59     
um messing around with that and uh so eventually I I got     
15:06     
got my model. Like I said, there's this T4 triunction     
15:13     
in the middle and the T3s were on the sides. And if I did anything else, it     
15:19     
did not work. And yeah, so they these tri junctions     
15:27     
are are small compared to to the rest of the structure, but very important. So     
15:34     
I've already got this at a micrometer scale. And then I put these triunctions in and     
15:41     
the program was more or less going, "What are you doing?     
15:48     
This is too small." Um,     
15:53     
I'm not supposed to think of a program having a personality, but in the end I     
15:59     
did. And these are the three models I used.     
16:04     
These are cuboidal um and uh these are squamish and and then     
16:12     
you had colmer ones.     
16:17     
So the properties of each of these, even though they're basically the same structure, just different heights, had     
16:25     
different properties, which also is interesting, but     
16:30     
our epithelial cells come in cuboidal, squamish, and col. So,     
16:38     
and I could have played with the heights of these some more because they the properties did change     
16:45     
when you change the height. I guess that it's kind of obvious when you think of it, but     
16:52     
yeah. Anyway, um yeah,     
16:57     
to boundary conditions, I attached um     
17:02     
spring foundations um to to the bottom.     
17:13     
and the next. And then I had to have some pinned points. So on these uh posts     
17:21     
I I put um pinned pinned points.     
17:28     
I just so the model would work, right? Yeah. And so I could change the spring     
17:36     
foundation. I could change the pre-strings for the bars and strings. And I try I     
17:44     
kept them the same like I didn't that makes mechanical sense to keep the     
17:50     
bars and strings at the same pre-strain. And then I did a range of forces     
17:58     
on them on the middle of the oh on the middle part of the U structure.     
18:08     
Did I show that? Yes. Okay. I applied the um force to the top     
18:17     
um and the middle at the three top points of the middle of     
18:23     
the structure like if you zoom in it in on it there are three three points here.     
18:30     
Okay. Anyway, that's what I did. And then I     
18:37     
used a range of spring foundations, range of pre-strings, a range of forces.     
18:43     
And then I had to do the whole thing um     
18:50     
by hand. I had to individually apply each one of these forces to the middle.     
18:57     
I couldn't automate it. Like usually you automate it by telling the program, "Oh,     
19:02     
go between this force and that force. and draw me a graph.     
19:08     
Well, no. I had to do this individually and then draw my own graph.     
19:15     
I might have been able to hook it up to mat lab so that mat lab would have drawn     
19:22     
the graph for me and I just about then I just never mind.     
19:28     
I'm just going to do this and be done with it instead of messing around with the program. And I would have had all of     
19:36     
my data by the time I'd figured out how to use mat lab with console console.     
19:44     
Yeah. Okay. So this is I was measuring     
19:49     
engineering stress and it's on this top triangle triangle on these three points     
19:58     
and I should have had that um I should have had this earlier. I suppose it would have flowed flowed     
20:05     
better but I didn't. And then I did engineering strain.     
20:13     
So um I measured the change in height to the initial height.     
20:20     
These are the results here. Um     
20:26     
so overall observations of the three um     
20:32     
cell tissue model was influenced by the     
20:38     
uh values of the strings and bars and the connections. So that was the cellto     
20:44     
cell connections at the tri junctions and the cellto     
20:50     
basement membrane attachments.     
20:55     
And this occurs in in other other models of cells.     
21:04     
And so I had um sample graphs and it's     
21:09     
backwards to what you think um because we've got um this is     
21:16     
tension and it it goes from here downwards. This is engineering. So this     
21:24     
is flipped on its head because um tension goes down and uh compression     
21:32     
goes up. Anyways, what I was looking for was a separation of these curves     
21:40     
um for different pre-streams.     
21:46     
In other words, the cell has control over its environment if you have um if     
21:53     
it can um pre-strain itself. And it does because it's got the     
21:59     
acttomyasin belt and it can um tension     
22:05     
that. So it's got it can have a different pre-strain and so it it can     
22:11     
act differently um to force. So there can be a different     
22:17     
displacement curve for different forces. And then this is I've already showed you     
22:24     
the um values for K. And then I had a couple more um these are the cellto cell     
22:31     
connections. Uh these are two compression curves. And this is compared. I should have labeled this     
22:38     
better. This is a squamish cell and this is a squamish cell.     
22:51     
This is the result of changing membrane width from 2 to 0.5 micrometers.     
23:02     
Okay. So this is um 12 0.12     
23:08     
micrometers in depth and this is     
23:14     
0.5 micrometers in depth.     
23:20     
So you have to have um a certain width     
23:27     
of the um the top part of the cell like the     
23:35     
um the membrane has to be wide enough     
23:42     
for a separation of these curves. This is basically a fail.     
23:49     
The only thing that's different is something without pre-strain and the rest of the the um pre-strains     
23:57     
um kind of end up on the same line.     
24:03     
So a cell does better in this environment. So um     
24:09     
the membrane of 0.12 micrometers works better than 0.05 micrometers.     
24:17     
I thought this was an interesting result. Uh this is a very good um     
24:23     
separation of curves here and this is a polymer model. So col     
24:28     
models work work very well     
24:34     
at certain prestrains. Um     
24:40     
and the cell to basement membrane attachments um     
24:47     
also have a um an effect on this. Uh     
24:52     
let's see. Sorry I I didn't go through this before I presented it. That's fine.     
24:58     
It's been a year. Yeah. Okay. The pre-strain curves become more     
25:05     
linear. Um and the pre-strain zero is separated from the other pre-strain curves by a     
25:12     
lot increasing the elasticity of the zero pre strain curve. Okay.     
25:22     
This could represent a diseased state like this curve here could represent a     
25:28     
diseased state. Yeah. Anyway,     
25:34     
this is what I wanted to show you. Um, I actually found some um data for single     
25:43     
cell sheets, which is more or less what I was modeling     
25:48     
and I did manage to match um my tensgrity model curves to to the curves     
25:55     
for this. Um these are more um J curve J     
26:00     
shaped curves than what I ended up with which was more     
26:06     
or less a straight line is a straight line. Um but the the curve     
26:13     
that matched these best was again uh these oriented cell sheets, single     
26:20     
cell sheets. And these were um the tension and strain were measured at 90°     
26:29     
to to how the cells were laid out. So these cells are laid out. These are     
26:36     
not not oriented. But then you had oriented cell sheets here.     
26:42     
And you can I don't know if you can see that, but they're lined up like this. So     
26:47     
these curves were measuring the stretch going this way.     
26:54     
And then the next next um ones here were     
26:59     
this were measuring the cells going perpendicular like they were stretching them perpendicular     
27:06     
to their layout. And I got very good results for matching     
27:12     
my model to this strain curve. And     
27:17     
the main reason why this was a good model was cover because it covered all     
27:24     
of the strain. It went from zero to 40 or it's 0 to 50%.     
27:33     
And it it just matched it just matched these curves like the the tissue broke     
27:39     
at these points. And my model went     
27:44     
to that and beyond. And usually the models only get up to     
27:52     
10% and then they deviate like they don't match curves.     
28:00     
They don't last that long. For instance, something like an Ogden     
28:05     
model, if you've ever heard of that. And um this was an interesting     
28:14     
um curve or it this is the actual data and     
28:20     
it was all over the place but it kind of followed a pattern and this is the     
28:27     
pattern and I was able to match it with my model     
28:34     
and it was interesting because the 10% % pre-strain is here on top and the     
28:44     
45% pre-strain was on the bottom. And this is all in compression.     
28:52     
And it's opposite to how this normally works. Normally you have a 10%     
29:00     
on the bottom and a 45% pre-strain on the top. And I my model     
29:07     
actually actually did that in some instances. So,     
29:13     
that was interesting as well. I could get it to to flip from uh 10% on the top     
29:22     
and um 45% on the bottom to having 45%     
29:29     
on the top to 10% on the bottom just depending on the parameters I used.     
29:35     
So I could play with it that way, which was a surprise.     
29:42     
And then I compared the human skin tension. Um, used a cubuidal model and a     
29:51     
Squamish model. So the cubuidal model ended up here     
29:57     
and it's in the dotted line. And the Squamish one is the green     
30:03     
one here that's kind of in the middle. And that's when I I changed um the K     
30:11     
value I was talking about so that the curves were kind of matching what was going on.     
30:19     
They still don't have this uh um J J curve thing going on. My model only did     
30:26     
um straight um straight lines and that was too bad. But     
30:34     
considering it was made out of sticks and rods and there were only three     
30:39     
cells, it was it was uh rather simple. we'll     
30:46     
just say compared to um a bunch of thousands of cells     
30:53     
say in skin. That's why um that's why this model of single cells     
31:01     
was um a more accurate thing to compare it to.     
31:07     
Anyways, I had conclusions that uh if you want to see them um     
31:14     
so I can do my my model work to um match     
31:19     
just chain curves of um actual real tissue. Um     
31:28     
main conclusion is that tissues that like tissues the model is um reliant on     
31:34     
their attachments and the values in its structure. In     
31:39     
other words, the elasticity value of the strings and rods     
31:47     
and my model modeled beyond what other     
31:52     
other models were doing like the Ogden model models. The Ogden model can do up to     
32:00     
20%. And most tissues yield at about 50%     
32:05     
strain. So they're not covering the full range of the tissue and my model covered     
32:12     
that. So they said it was a done deal and that I proven that I had actually     
32:18     
modeled something. So any any questions?     
32:25     
Yeah, thank you Susan. That was good. Uh I had a couple of questions uh related     
32:31     
to some of the things that you talked about. uh one is that you you know you     
32:36     
mentioned pre-stresses and pre-strains and then you know what does that mean in terms of the biology? What would be an     
32:42     
example of a pre-stress and what would be an example of a pre-strain in biology?     
32:49     
Um well muscles naturally have tension while     
32:55     
you're alive like they're normally tensioned. So um that's like prestring like it     
33:04     
isn't totally flaccid. Um     
33:10     
Okay. And there Yeah. And and there's um squamish uh epithelial cells covering     
33:19     
most tissues and so they're holding an organ and those are naturally tensioned.     
33:29     
If they aren't, that means it's broken. So um that's a couple of examples. Um     
33:39     
tissue also um naturally um     
33:45     
um takes that triunction that's in or the the belt of acttomyosin that that     
33:52     
surrounds them. When they're a um epithelial tissue, they'll have this belt at the top of the cells or the     
34:00     
bottom of the cell actually. and they they can um contract that     
34:07     
and that'll cause a a tension and also you you get waves of tension and pulling     
34:13     
throughout cells. It just occurs when there's movement.     
34:20     
All right. Does that help? Yeah. So there's a dynamics there. It's not     
34:26     
just like a a single measurement like you know we tend to think of these things as like I'll just take a     
34:33     
measurement and this is the sort of the output. But I mean it's nonlinear, but it's like uh you know, you'll just     
34:40     
think, well, that's that's what it looks like if you just kind of test this one little structure. But we're thinking     
34:46     
about tissue where we have all these different things interacting these maybe these different tensity structures     
34:53     
interacting or larger tensity structures connected to other things and that     
34:59     
produces some interesting dynamics. connect to like if     
35:05     
you have ligament attached to bone for instance, right? And that's attached to muscle. So you're     
35:12     
always always have uh some sort of tension going on,     
35:18     
right? So you get waves and then the waves kind of go through the tissue.     
35:23     
Waves. Yeah. Yeah. I sent you um um     
35:29     
a paper about waves in um the beetle     
35:37     
this week says spatial temporal segmentation of     
35:43     
contraction waves in the extra embriionic membranes of the     
35:48     
red flower beetle. Okay. I I sent that to you and uh I was hoping     
35:56     
that Dick would see that because we don't know what these waves do.     
36:04     
Yeah. Probably causing celliation, right? I didn't I didn't pull that up for this     
36:11     
week, but yeah, it's we'll have to go over that. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Well, I'll stop sharing.     
36:17     
Okay. Yeah. So, that's that's interesting. And then you know we have these different uh     
36:24     
sort of you know use or I call them use cases but real world implications of     
36:30     
these models. So you know we have a tense segrity which is of course we     
36:36     
could describe a lot of things as tensgities. They exist within a tissue and then they have these dynamics.     
36:43     
Um and yeah it's like you know we have like studies where they measure the stresses and strains in some system     
36:52     
and then that's that's the data that we have right like we're not going to get better data we're not going to get like     
36:59     
real time data where it's like just measuring things is     
37:05     
the um as far as I know if if if you haven't measured it in stress and strain     
37:12     
it doesn't exist for an engineer. Yeah, it doesn't mean anything.     
37:19     
Yeah, I know. It's uh Okay, so yeah, I think that's that's     
37:25     
good for now. Yeah, thanks for adding to that slideshow. Again, like I said, we we'll be going through the slideshow and     
37:32     
adding in things and, you know, like kind of crafting it down to something     
37:37     
and then, you know, we'll go from there. I just wanted to get a lot of that in one place and kind of think about what     
37:44     
the core sort of mathematics are, what the core ideas are that we can distill     
37:51     
down. And I'm still I still don't understand the     
37:56     
the math. Yeah. Well, it's for this because they do this in several     
38:01     
different ways, right? They do have different methodologies. Yeah. And     
38:07     
and I did have when I messed it up. I did have a     
38:12     
paper about um uh 10seges with um nonstretchy     
38:21     
strengths because um according to um Steven Leaven the     
38:31     
cells or the biological tissue don't have um     
38:38     
that much stretch. stretch in them. And a proper tenseity is more like a string     
38:44     
and not it's not an elastic, right? It's a string.     
38:50     
And so they they don't stretch very much, right? So I I had that um     
38:58     
article about working with um strings that were not that didn't change in     
39:05     
length and that were were not that elastic. It's around here somewhere, right?     
39:12     
Yeah. So that I mean that brings up another question which is that tissues are isot anizotropic     
39:18     
which means that they have different like the different parts of the tissue have different properties. So you have     
39:24     
like say for example muscle and bone and they have their own sort of uh prop     
39:31     
physical properties and so in your modeling I know in a 10 segity you're kind of breaking that apart and saying     
39:36     
this tissue type is or this this thing this this cell type has a certain sort     
39:44     
of set of properties and they fit into the tense segrity structure but you know it's it's I don't know has is that like     
39:51     
do you think that's a problem or do you think that's just kind of baked into the tensity model.     
39:57     
They're you have to model them from the actual structure of the tissue like     
40:03     
that. I why I chose epithelial tissue. It's it's fairly simple and it's a single um it's not a single layer but     
40:10     
you can do a single layer layer. There are some epithelial tissues that are single layer. Um, if you look at uh the     
40:18     
structure of epithelial tissue, say of skin, it starts off with that with     
40:24     
things that sort of look like my model to to a deeper structure and they're     
40:30     
more of the the docahedron. That's what they are     
40:36     
docahedron type um structure. So, it changes as as you go um in depth. And     
40:45     
then you have to where they're attached to each other at the the tri junctions or um whatever     
40:54     
they're using for attachments to each other and then you have to model last.     
41:01     
Yeah. Yeah. And the tenseity structure inside is     
41:07     
does change. I believe it's just where it is at that moment in time.     
41:15     
Yeah. And I just it's a very simple the simplest tense segity structure I could     
41:21     
to get a hexagonal 3D structure. So it might be more     
41:27     
complex than that. I don't know. I um I tried to change that and add more     
41:34     
structure to it and it just fails. It falls over, right? Um     
41:40     
yeah. Um, and I I put extra um     
41:48     
physically extra bars and strings in the middle trying to mimic the top     
41:55     
and bottom of the cell and it didn't add like it just did not add to the     
42:03     
attachments. You could, but that might be a that's probably a fault of the     
42:09     
program, but maybe it's also a structural thing. And I never got to check it out. Like they wanted this     
42:15     
thing done by Christmas. Yeah. Here it is.     
42:20     
You can only do so much. Yeah. But I I put extra stuff uh stuff     
42:29     
basically on the top on the membrane of the cell.     
42:34     
And the only thing that made a difference was the depth. And it it I could put all kinds of different things     
42:40     
in the middle. And it didn't make a difference to the properties. Like it     
42:46     
maybe started its linear path sooner or     
42:51     
later, but it was basically the same curve.     
42:56     
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Uh yeah. Thanks. Thanks for that.     
43:04     
All right. Um, these can get these things cheaper, but yeah, sort of.     
43:11     
So, it looks like we have Baron and Shreas. Uh, welcome.     
43:16     
Um, I don't know if wanted to introduce yourselves or     
43:25     
Yeah. Hi. I'm Yes.     
43:31     
Yeah. Hi. So yeah, I did have a chat with like um Jrat and I worked on things     
43:38     
as suggested. So yeah, we can discuss that if you want.     
43:44     
That's good. Yeah. Um sounds good. Um     
43:50     
Barandi, did you want to say anything? All right. Why don't we move on to uh     
43:57     
some of the things I wanted to talk about? Um     
44:02     
so this is a uh commit to do graph. This     
44:08     
was something that was uh committed this weekend. So we had adbased graph with     
44:14     
hyper edge support and tests. Um this was by Ashi Rajput     
44:20     
and um or Ashi Rajput08. And so this adds some functionality to     
44:26     
some of the things that are going on in the uh in the DVLearn in the uh graph     
44:32     
neural networks repository. So again you know this is just adding to     
44:39     
the capabilities of that software. So thank you for that uh commit.     
44:45     
Uh hello sir am I audible now? Yes. Yes.     
44:53     
Okay. So, uh I'll give myself a introduction because this is my first meeting. So, I'm an undergraduate in my     
45:00     
final year and I'm currently pursuing my bachelor's in techology. So,     
45:07     
uh I went through the past two meetings uh past two weekly meetings and I also went through the uh previous year's     
45:14     
recap. So what I got from that is uh a very good sentence that they said in the     
45:20     
last that a living thing is much more than sum of its parts. So uh that like     
45:25     
sums up the aim for the next year. So I guess we are looking more towards the other outer forces which influence the     
45:33     
living being than just the embryo and its inner organs.     
45:39     
So uh taking this into account I also went through a paper which uh looks into     
45:45     
marovian dynamics and uh I feel like that would be a great uh paper to work     
45:52     
on and keeping that as a foundation paper we could go forward with that. So I also prepared a kind of an overview as     
45:59     
a presentation if uh Brad I could present that.     
46:05     
Yeah. If you if you want to do that now, you can. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, it's     
46:11     
it's actually very interesting that I went through it because I'm very new to neuroscience and uh taking control of an     
46:19     
organism is kind of a big deal for me. So, I'll just present my screen right now. U all right. So, is it visible?     
46:30     
Yes. Yes, it is. Okay. So, this is the paper. So uh micro     
46:36     
marovian dynamics for C elegance and its behavior across scales. So these are     
46:41     
some of the people who uh worked on this and I'll just go straight to the paper. So the problem that they went through     
46:48     
was that uh living beings move in complex ways and it's hard to connect     
46:53     
the tiny body movements like which takes in milliseconds into the long-term movements like finding food which takes     
46:59     
like minutes for them. So they've created a model called the mark of worm     
47:05     
which predicts the worm's future based on the previous movements or the current movements or the sequence of movements     
47:10     
it has been through. Uh so this is kind of a picture. I'll explain the top right     
47:17     
corner of it. So what this is is uh it breaks the movement of the worm into     
47:25     
something called iggon worms which is like uh numbers which is used to represent the     
47:31     
movement of the worm and they want to break it into five uh coefficients we     
47:37     
can say. Uh so this is one part of it and let's     
47:42     
talk about the data which they used. Uh so they're like they recorded like 12 worms for 35 minutes each and they     
47:49     
captured around 33,000 frames. So so a snapshot of the worm is not really any     
47:56     
of any use. So we need to see the whole movie clip to know what is going to be in the next second. So uh they took like     
48:04     
a sequence of 11 frames which they used to feed into the model to predict the next frame.     
48:10     
And this sequence is where called microates. So as you can see this small uh picture.     
48:19     
Uh so here a t plus k refers to the uh building blocks of the sequence and     
48:27     
they're like the single body shape at one moment of the worm and the whole x k of t is the collection of the shapes     
48:34     
over 11 frames which is then inputed into the worm model to generate the next     
48:39     
sequence. And after that uh we have this which is     
48:44     
like the calculation of the probability of the worm while it's switching from one state to the another. And let's say     
48:52     
if for an example if the worm is curling left state what are the o odds of it switching to straightening out or     
49:00     
curling harder than it already is. So using this model we can of course     
49:05     
generate a virtual bomb which behaves like the real one and uh when we are     
49:13     
plotting this movements I'll show it. Uh so it's like a U map. We plotted it out.     
49:20     
And this small dot is like the movement of the worm. And the blue uh refers to     
49:27     
the forward runs of the worm. And this bluish and orangish splints they refer     
49:33     
to the uh turns or reversal of the worms like if they're turning.     
49:39     
Uh next we can go through the so the main aim like the main discovery     
49:46     
of this paper was basically they invented a lot of new behaviors of the walk. Uh previously it was just two     
49:52     
famous behaviors which was like running straight or like turning around from his place. So this new discovery uh revealed     
50:01     
like seven new subbehaviors which was like fast wide runs, slow dorsal runs     
50:06     
and of five more which are I guess told over here uh uh deep vententral periods     
50:13     
and a lot more which you can see and this is their result. Um once again yeah     
50:21     
so this is the result. So, so there was a problem in their uh model like when     
50:27     
they were like trying to get this posture to the path. So, how it's moving     
50:32     
like relating it to them. So, cuz it was mostly specific on how the worm is     
50:39     
bending and not where it is bending or uh the you can say the friction related     
50:44     
to it. So they also use the concept of residive force theory which sir explained I guess last week and uh they     
50:52     
use the physics equations to also take into account the drag forces of the worm's body against the sticky gel     
50:58     
basically which is which it crawls on and uh and they were successful in this actually. So this is the uh their     
51:06     
results where the blue line is the simulation of the worm and the black     
51:11     
line is the actual data of the worm and they were pretty close to it and these are some physics equations uh which they     
51:18     
integrated into the model further and so lastly     
51:24     
we have those behaviors and how they have made a behavioral tree like how     
51:30     
this runs like more like a a tree which uh if this is yes and this is no, it     
51:35     
leads to this kind of behavior. And so the paper is mostly based on the     
51:42     
probability of like finding food based on the movements of this worm and they     
51:47     
were pretty accurate about the results.     
51:53     
uh that's all mostly that I researched about for this weekend     
51:59     
and I think that this would be a very good foundation paper to move forward with with the aim of this year.     
52:08     
That's very good. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Very good. Um let's     
52:14     
see. Susan had a thing in the chat here     
52:19     
which was uh this citation that     
52:25     
form finding method for um strings that are basically non elastic.     
52:32     
Okay. Inextensible. That's what they're calling it.     
52:37     
That's all. Okay. Um yeah, thank you for that. Uh so yeah back to Barian's presentation.     
52:44     
Thank you for doing that. U yeah the IGENORM's paper that was actually something that um some collaborators of     
52:51     
Openworm did a while back. Um and Openworm of course had its movement     
52:58     
database uh you know uh where they characterized a bunch of worm movements     
53:04     
through microscopy and had a database which I'm not sure what the status of the database is right now. Um but those     
53:12     
data are out there and uh you know the idea was to take the     
53:17     
observations of movement in the adult worms do the iigen worm decompositions     
53:24     
and then characterize movements from them. And you know that's that's     
53:30     
interesting you know just kind of getting the movement like decomposing the different movement data because     
53:36     
usually what we have and this holds true for like movements in the embryo as well     
53:42     
as the behavioral movements is we just have like cell tracking or you know uh     
53:48     
feature tracking which is where you have like an image and then that image is um     
53:56     
is segmented and you have like the the components of the of the thing that     
54:01     
you're observing. It could be the individual cells. It could be the body and then you basically you know     
54:08     
decompose those movements over time. So you look at the dynamics of the you know     
54:14     
different positions and you put that together and you and you find like the things that describe     
54:23     
those path those trajectories. Now, you know, that's something that I     
54:28     
think would be interesting applied to like embryos because we have data where we look at embryos over time. We look at     
54:36     
cell divisions, we look at like, you know, migration of cells. And it's, you     
54:42     
know, it's interesting because I don't know if people have done that where they've taken different cells in     
54:47     
development, tracked them, and then looked at the movements and described them in in that way like where you have     
54:55     
like a ien migration or iigen     
55:00     
movement. Yeah. Well, yeah, but in this case, it would be like I en embryo or     
55:05     
I en Yeah. cell. I don't know. But the point being is you can use that same methodology in     
55:11     
development. It'd be interesting to know uh it would uncover some new information.     
55:18     
Um yeah, so that's good stuff. Yeah. So     
55:25     
yeah, that's great. And then of course that can t that could tie into 10 segreities     
55:30     
uh looking at sort of the stability of structures.     
55:36     
um you know I don't know well I think there     
55:41     
yeah forces right     
55:48     
um yeah the like the functional modes in 10segretes I think that's you know you     
55:53     
just look at the things that are stable or if you do a simulation you look at the things that are stable and unstable     
55:59     
and you're actually extracting IGEN values in the matrices in in in tense     
56:04     
it's like you have these matrices of the different components of the 10segrity network. It's represented as some sort     
56:11     
of matrix and then you're taking components of the matrix diagonals     
56:17     
uh rows columns and then getting the igen values for that and then it's     
56:22     
um you know what what does that describe? It describes different modes     
56:28     
soft modes other modes.     
56:36     
and tense integrity structures. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.     
56:42     
Okay. So, that's good. Uh why don't we call a meeting then? Um thanks for attending.     
56:49     
Thank you for Susan and Baran for presenting. Those are good uh presentations.     
56:54     
Uh hello. Yeah. Hi. Yeah. Hi. If we have time I would like     
57:01     
to also present like uh Ja told me like uh I had a chat with him as to what are     
57:07     
the aims of this year and what he worked on and I cleared my doubts with him. So he asked me to work on the connect to uh     
57:13     
data set. So I did work on it and if we have time should I present or should I     
57:18     
push it to next week? Oh actually we could do that. Why don't you why don't you go ahead and present? Yeah why don't you do that?     
57:26     
Yeah sure sure. So u wait just a second before we     
57:32     
proceed. Yeah. So J told me that like we I can uh like find the intermediate     
57:38     
state of connect connections between two snapshots. So like we the data set is such that we are given like snapshots of     
57:46     
various connection like L1, L2, L3 and so on. This from it's like from the baby stage to the adult stage and we need the     
57:53     
um like the states between like we don't know the states it's just two snapshots. So he asked me like he he couldn't     
58:00     
explore in that direction. So he asked me if I can do it. So I did go ahead and I got two papers. So one is a latent     
58:07     
latent OD for a regular sample time series. So what I observed is that just     
58:13     
a second I'll go up and yeah so we have like eight files. So between those files     
58:21     
the time series which we have is not equally sampled. So say there is the gap of 1 hour between L1 and L2. And then     
58:27     
there's a gap of 8 R between L2 and L3 like L L1 L2 I'm referring to the states     
58:32     
as to um so L1 L2 are the states of the connecttome. So for that uh uh this     
58:39     
paper I got which is the latent OD. So it's a differential equation solver which can solve any differential     
58:44     
equation. So why is it so? I'll just get to this in some time. And this other paper is a graph neural ordinary     
58:50     
differential equations. So what this does is so I'll go ahead with this paper first like just in short I'll give a oneline short intro of this. So what     
58:57     
what this does is like since conneto is a graph and it's not like it depends on the neighboring connections as well. So     
59:03     
this models the full connector as a graph uh and in a temporal way like that it can like it can add nodes and so on     
59:10     
and then since like each node has an internal representation with the graph neural network. So I combined both of     
59:17     
these papers and tried to deise a method where the internal vector which is made     
59:23     
uh so that is evolving and we find a differential equation to model it like how that vector changes from say state     
59:29     
one like L1 to L2 to L3 till adult. So if we get the differential equation then we can just give any time step between     
59:35     
L1 and two say like some time step like one one one and a half hour. So what is     
59:41     
the state of conneto at the time 1 and a half hour. So that's why I got went in this direction. So when I went in this     
59:49     
direction um yeah so basically what I'm doing here is um should I go through the     
59:54     
code or should I just give a overview and then if any doubts I'll go in the code. So here I'm just preparing the     
1:00:00     
data set like all the tensors and all to do the data preparation. Then I'm defining the conneto od solver. So this     
1:00:07     
is the ordinary different differential equation solver which solves the internal vectors for this like it models     
1:00:14     
the differential equation for the internal vectors of the neural network. Now one point like the most important     
1:00:19     
point is that like this is the uh just a second. Yeah. So this is a GCN     
1:00:26     
conf. So this is what makes the internal vectors. So there's we we have a graph convolution network which makes the     
1:00:32     
internal vectors and then the OD function works on those internal vectors and it uh learns the ordinary     
1:00:40     
differential equation for the internal vectors. This is a point to be noted like it's not like it learns for the connectto it learns for the internal     
1:00:45     
vector which is modeled by the graph convolution network. Right? So we train this thing over like some 2,000 epochs     
1:00:53     
and then this loss converges. I was a bit surprised as to why the loss converts so steeply initially and then     
1:00:59     
quite slow later. But yeah, then here we do the missing frames prediction like     
1:01:04     
the interpolation. Um I just sample like a bunch of like say time at 0.5 1 1.5 23     
1:01:12     
and so on. So uh how the thing is model is that I'll just go here. So we have uh     
1:01:20     
say we have approximately 220 total number of neurons. So from like uh zero     
1:01:26     
it starts with like some some less number of neurons and it goes on increasing. So what I did is like I     
1:01:31     
created a 10 I created a matrix where all the neurons are present like 220x 220 and then all values were zero     
1:01:37     
initially right and then whichever neurons were active like since the number of neurons were increasing uh     
1:01:43     
with time. So initially all were zero those were getting active were turned on to one and then accordingly uh things     
1:01:49     
were trained right. So this is a general overview of what I did. I didn't go into the math and the loss function and the     
1:01:55     
like training part of it. Uh for a matter of fact, I used um binary cross entropy with logic loss. So like yeah     
1:02:02     
binary cross entropy with with log logic loss for this model. And yeah so this is     
1:02:08     
the connections. So this is like connection between okay one more thing I'll just come come. So this is like     
1:02:14     
here what we're doing is say there are connections between various neurons right? Say I have n number of neurons.     
1:02:21     
So n cross n I can have in third degree in mathematically I can have n cross n connect n and cn connections right each     
1:02:27     
neuron connected to other neuron. So this which actually doesn't happen in biology. So this is like the connection     
1:02:32     
probability as to what neuron can be connected to some other neuron. So that is the graph which I'm that is the heat     
1:02:38     
map which I'm plotting. So this is the heat map for it and this is this seems continuous as to like it seems like okay     
1:02:44     
fine. However, the like initially the blue connections here are quite here is quite less and here it increases and so     
1:02:50     
we can see that the connections are increasing in a natural way but I don't claim that these results are quite     
1:02:56     
accurate because this is a preliminary um like development by me like I just took two papers I found papers and I     
1:03:03     
tried to merge it and get a new method but yeah this is a preliminary exam examination for if the method works I'll     
1:03:09     
get input from you and work on this further so yeah this is what I did and one more thing Just to end like the last     
1:03:15     
note that uh since the connections are sparse like the matrix which uh I saw was quite sparse like not every since     
1:03:23     
ncn uh ncn is a very large number but the actual connections are quite less     
1:03:28     
right. So for that what I did is in the loss function if say the model predicts     
1:03:33     
some connection which is there like say say the connection is one but it predicts it to be zero which is off. So     
1:03:38     
then the loss is quite high. But if some connection is off and it predicts on the     
1:03:44     
loss is like normal but if the like if it predicts wrongly for the uh imbalance     
1:03:50     
class then the loss is quite high. So that is the way through which I tried to balance it. So like this is the positive     
1:03:56     
weight for loss like five positive weight. So it's like 5x 5x loss it will incor if it predicts a imbalanced class     
1:04:03     
incorrectly. So yeah uh any questions? Yeah, thank you. Thank you. That was great. Yeah, I     
1:04:11     
I like this um approach of using um ODEs     
1:04:17     
to describe the conneto evolution. So I know that last year we did temporal     
1:04:22     
graphs just the temporal graph outline and then you know having the different stages     
1:04:28     
and now we have like ODEs that kind of fit the dynamics together. Um, and I     
1:04:34     
know like on in Saturday's meeting, I know Morgan had talked about people     
1:04:39     
doing like stuff with neural differential equations and how that's     
1:04:44     
sort of a new newer field. Um, but yeah, this is good. This is good. Thank you.     
1:04:51     
Uh, so that's yeah, that's again using conneto data so we can look at the dynamics there. All right.     
1:04:57     
Right. So um what would you like from your end what can be the improvements like what do you think should be done in     
1:05:03     
a better way or modeling any input from your side so that I can work for next week on that?     
1:05:09     
Um I don't know just just work on improving the technique or maybe doing a     
1:05:15     
couple of demos where you you know um show kind of the connection between the     
1:05:21     
data set and the graphs that you're producing. So, you know, you produce like the the heat maps and and things     
1:05:28     
like that, but it's, you know, hard to see kind of where that's coming from and     
1:05:33     
understanding what the code is doing. So, you know, um then of course go     
1:05:41     
through and optimize the code and kind of figure out you know if if uh     
1:05:46     
uh you know what what exactly is um the key thing that you know we should take     
1:05:53     
away from it. you know, how does it perform? I don't think you can really I mean, I guess you could vary things um     
1:05:59     
in the data set, but uh just to show kind of what you know what the power of     
1:06:05     
this method is. Um right. Yeah, I get it. Understood.     
1:06:11     
Okay, I'll work on this. And one more thing I was thinking which I'll work on is that uh uh like there are no labels,     
1:06:17     
right? I'm predicting what is the u uh connections between two time frames. So there are not there are not many labels     
1:06:24     
to us to see if it is correct. So is there any way through which we can see if the outputs which I'm getting are     
1:06:30     
actually that good. Now what I'm saying is that the interpolation looks systematic like the transition looks     
1:06:36     
smooth is what I'm seeing but I want some like grounded proof that okay the     
1:06:41     
thing which I'm doing actually makes sense. So what do you think in this context? Well, the data set that you're     
1:06:47     
working from, doesn't that have labels? Like in terms of if you're looking at different synapses, well, some of the     
1:06:54     
data are just kind of counts. So, those aren't technically labeled, but some of     
1:06:59     
them also have like specific cells that the synapses are associated with or     
1:07:06     
pairs of cells. Um, I don't know exactly what data set, you know, you're plotting     
1:07:12     
it out with. That's kind of one of the things that we kind of need to figure out like go back and look at the source     
1:07:19     
data and say this is the input and then this is the potential label or this is     
1:07:25     
the potential thing that we're um you know putting into the model and then we     
1:07:31     
can kind of because we can create labels uh sometimes if we know kind of where     
1:07:37     
the data is coming from like we have other data sets that we can use to sort of uh augment ment what we have. So we     
1:07:44     
create labels that way. So yeah, there are a lot of things we can do, but I I     
1:07:49     
need to know kind of where things are coming from or we need to know that.     
1:08:00     
Well, um thanks for doing an overview of that. That sounds interesting.     
1:08:06     
I'm kind of interested in um your orthogonal um lab um talk like I saw it     
1:08:16     
and uh it it was the what's the paper you     
1:08:22     
presented a couple of weeks ago uh next generational stem cell models for studying brain development and disease.     
1:08:30     
Oh okay. Yeah. Oh maybe that was this last week. Yeah. was okay     
1:08:36     
maybe. Anyway, no, I just um I tried to look     
1:08:42     
some of it up online and couldn't um couldn't find find it from the Sloan     
1:08:50     
Kataring Institute for Cancer Research. Anyway, some of     
1:08:56     
um what Shiraz just u talked about kind of fits with some of the     
1:09:03     
Yeah. Yeah. waddles. Yeah, send me the title and I can get it for you.     
1:09:10     
Okay. I um Thanks. I have I have trouble getting things sometimes. So,     
1:09:16     
right. Maybe I'll just send you a couple of my problems. Yeah. Yeah. I put them in Word. I put the title in     
1:09:23     
Word and couldn't get couldn't get the paper. So, yeah.     
1:09:28     
All right. And flower beetle thing is on in the chat there. Great.     
1:09:34     
Yeah, that paper you took the bit. So, yeah. All right.     
1:09:39     
All right. Well, thanks for attending and um thanks to Baron and Shreas and Susan for presenting.     
1:09:47     
All right. Have a good
