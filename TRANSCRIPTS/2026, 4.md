Hello. Hi. Hi. How are you? PowerPoint.     
0:07     
Uh, no. I didn't check yet. Is this like something you just sent me? It's just because you were describing     
0:12     
brain development and it's due to um crawling cells. I went, "Oh, well, that     
0:19     
that's an explanation for why um things don't develop in microgravity." It's     
0:26     
just one of the things that goes wrong. I can show it to you if you want. Yeah, that'd be good. Why don't you go     
0:32     
ahead and show it? Hello, Barshan. Um, how are you?     
0:37     
Yeah, I'm I'm good, sir. Thank you. So, uh, I worked on that embryo thing.     
0:46     
So, I got a data set about cell tracking. Uh, it's a bit of a old data     
0:51     
set. I also prepared a presentation for it and I also have some code and results. So I can show that uh once we     
0:58     
have time for that. Yeah, we'll do that after Susan Susan's going to present something.     
1:05     
We'll let you present. Okay. Okay. So Okay. All right. Yeah. Looking forward to it.     
1:12     
Uh [clears throat] yes. So me too. Oh yeah. All right. I've got it. I'll share my     
1:18     
screen and then we you you can talk about it and and do that. Okay. Um so when since we were talking     
1:25     
[clears throat] about brain development um last week and it involved crawling     
1:30     
cells I went aha it's one of the reasons why things don't develop in     
1:36     
microgravity. So um anyway so I made a slideshow.     
1:44     
So um okay [clears throat] well this is just simulated microgravity and actual     
1:50     
microgravity is worse. So it alters uh morphology and this and cytokeleton     
1:57     
organization and cellular mobility     
2:02     
um and cytokeleton protein expression. And this is in rat hypothalamus but it     
2:09     
happens everywhere. And this is an example. Mind you, the cells usually     
2:14     
recover within 24 hours. You can adapt to microgravity which is really great.     
2:20     
But if you're a developing organism, it doesn't doesn't work so well. Um, so     
2:27     
this is what this these cells look like there. This is the you're looking at the     
2:34     
microtubules in this cell. And this is um a lymphosy. It it's um an immune cell     
2:43     
in the blood. And it looks like this in microgravity.     
2:50     
with and these are all disorganized. [clears throat]     
2:56     
So it's disorganization is the effect. Yeah. And then this is a summary in a     
3:02     
paper [clears throat] I wrote. And there's um the if you look at the bottom, these are cells in normal     
3:10     
gravity. And then there's cells in simulated     
3:15     
um 1g. And then there's cells in microgravity.     
3:20     
So there are differences. If you have cells in um space in microgravity and     
3:27     
you spin them, they they even look different from those in normal gravity.     
3:33     
And this is in a developing organism. So I think it was a rat     
3:39     
a rat pup ear or something. It would anyway it changes     
3:44     
um they change configuration depending on their environment, their gravity     
3:50     
environment. And if you look at the next column, you can see the um at the bottom what     
3:58     
microtubules I believe. Yeah, they're microtubules on Earth and they're it's a     
4:04     
very rich pattern. And then if you go up, you get microtubules in simulated microgravity.     
4:13     
So you're starting to see the problem here. Yeah. But um there's with without     
4:19     
vibration in A and with vibration in B. So even vibration will will help the     
4:27     
microtubules uh grow in um and then you get microtubules     
4:34     
in simulated uh oneg in space     
4:39     
and you can one's the side and one's the top and you can see that the pattern     
4:46     
there is not as rich as the microtubules on earth     
4:51     
and then you just get microtubules in space microgravity and there's about nothing there. It's just just not there.     
5:01     
And then you look at the differences in gene expression     
5:07     
[clears throat] and um you get in earth gravity normal     
5:12     
they're clustered and if you go into microgravity they spread they're they're     
5:18     
more spread out. So it even affects it affects gene     
5:23     
expression. Okay. Next, unless unless you want to see it. Okay. So, I just um     
5:31     
zoomed in on um the microtubules um in normal earth gravity and then in     
5:39     
simulated microgravity and um in microgravity but with     
5:46     
simulated one gravity and then microtubules in microgravity. So, so you     
5:53     
can see that better. It definitely affects um microtubules,     
5:59     
which is a major part of the cytokeleton. And they've even got one for microtubules in magnetic fields,     
6:06     
which is interesting. Oh, what's a magnetic field? Like what's the difference between a     
6:12     
magnetic field and and gravity? I don't know. [clears throat] I'll just say I don't know the exact     
6:20     
things but um [clears throat] someone did an experiment     
6:25     
and I can't find it but they did an experiment where they spun     
6:32     
um these flasks in a um in a magnetic     
6:37     
field in microgravity and it restored um it restored the patterning.     
6:43     
Okay. So yeah, and they also did it in um high     
6:51     
magnetic fields and if you have too high a magnetic field like say     
6:58     
um seven Tesla, you get um the microtubules     
7:05     
um [clears throat] align too much like they're very they align a lot. So that has something to do     
7:12     
with MRIs. Right. Yeah. So, um     
7:19     
Dick did an experiment with a 11.7     
7:25     
[clears throat] um Tesla magnetic field in an MRI with um salamander eggs.     
7:33     
They all died except for the ones that were about a foot away and they showed extreme     
7:39     
defects. So 11.7 Tesla, don't ever use it in an     
7:45     
MRI. That is a not a good idea. Well, I think for small animals, yeah, it is from what I've I've heard.     
7:53     
Yeah. [laughter] Yeah. No, it it does affect [clears throat] uh the microtubules.     
7:59     
Yeah. Yeah. [snorts] And if it's [clears throat] a developing animal, it's not a good plan. But um     
8:05     
what is it used for Tesla? Maybe in an MRI. It's not     
8:11     
right. Anyway, it's um it's a J curve again. You go you can go     
8:18     
up to six Tesla or something and there's really no effects. But then then it     
8:25     
takes off. Right. Right. So what by the time you get to 11 Tesla, it's like oops shouldn't have done that.     
8:34     
Anyways, that's just an aside. Anyway, ne next slide. So, these are some salamanders     
8:41     
that they sent into space uh my space station     
8:49     
and um salamander A there. I'm not sure what     
8:54     
to say about it. Um it was taken up to space at stage 55.     
9:02     
Um, and so it's a bit weird looking, at least to my     
9:08     
eyes, because I'm used to looking at salamanders. [gasps] And then, um, B is, um, is the one that     
9:17     
they sent up into microgravity and C is the ground control.     
9:24     
And if you look at the eyes, really zoom in on the eyes,     
9:30     
you'll notice that B looks crosseyed. I took one look at it and I said that     
9:36     
salamander is crosseyed. In other words, I [clears throat] believe it has microinsphily,     
9:42     
but I don't think they checked that. But that that's my thought on     
9:48     
[clears throat] on it. Okay, next slide. I hope there's a next slide.     
9:54     
Okay. [clears throat] So, uh reduction in in gravity leads to     
10:01     
reduction in the pre-stress of the actin network with neurons. Space flight     
10:07     
reduces um the actin fibers in human monocytes.     
10:14     
Okay. I don't know. and a few examples of as a astronauts suffering from     
10:19     
schizophrenia spectrum problems um during or following missions. Anyway, so     
10:25     
there there's an effect on the brain and on uh the immune system and I don't     
10:33     
know if there's is there a next slide did I manage next slide? Oh,     
10:41     
okay. So crawling um cells in brain     
10:46     
development [clears throat] um migrating tang tangentally and radially     
10:52     
um and if they don't migrate you get micrinephily. So what happens in     
10:59     
microgravity the cytokeleton isn't working as well as it should for various reasons and you     
11:05     
don't get um the cells placed where they should be.     
11:12     
because crawling cells have difficulties in in microgravity like I said including     
11:17     
immune cells and so I don't know is there a next slide or     
11:22     
I forget oh okay well I circled the crawling cells here     
11:29     
so you you need those you need them to crawl where they need to be in order to     
11:35     
create a a [clears throat] decent brain so I I suspect the salamanders s     
11:43     
that were in that flight um were not normal as they claimed at first     
11:50     
but that they had micro and sephille or something else going wrong with them     
11:55     
anyway so I guess is that it that yeah basically that's the takeaway     
12:01     
yeah that that's just it then yeah so microgravity alters cytokeleton     
12:07     
and will alter migration of cells correct All right, that looks great. Thank you, Susan. Um, yeah, that's     
12:14     
always uh fun to look at um some of these results.     
12:21     
Yeah. So, um so m a magnetic field will restore     
12:27     
cytokeleton up to a point and then it destroys it. Yeah. Yeah. You have to get it right.     
12:33     
You have to hit the right spot. [clears throat] So, is it like that? It's like a field     
12:41     
that's realigning it and then if you have too much of it, it just kind of uh     
12:47     
overwhelms it um it really it aligns the micro     
12:54     
tubules and keeps them there. And uh there's a cancer medication that does     
13:00     
the same thing and people lose their short-term memory while they're on that     
13:06     
drug. And it and it's the same idea. They     
13:11     
cells that are reproduce [clears throat] um a lot are um     
13:19     
stalled by by aligning the microtubules. I used to     
13:24     
know the name of it and gave it to my sister [laughter]     
13:29     
going, "Yeah." Um [clears throat] she says, "Yeah, my short-term memory is gone." [laughter] And I went, "Yeah, well, they're giving     
13:36     
you that drug." Yes. [clears throat] Anyway, she she recovered.     
13:44     
My sister's brilliant and normally doesn't have these problems with her memory.     
13:50     
Anyway, that's great. Thank you, Susan. Yeah.     
13:58     
Yeah. Thank you. That was great. Um, so yeah. Any other thoughts?     
14:07     
Okay. So, yeah. So, after this presentation, I had a few questions out of curiosity. Uh, so after looking     
14:15     
through microgravity, I had this question. Does it anyways speed up speed up the growth of the organism or does it     
14:23     
only affect the sequences like the gene sequences and the protein sequences?     
14:28     
Uh so does it just lead to uh a kind of mutation or does it also speed up the     
14:34     
growth in any ways? Um [clears throat] in some things it speeds up the growth.     
14:40     
Um but it it alters it alters the cytokeleton which will alter the gene     
14:47     
expression. Okay. So, it's     
14:54     
it's not a good thing. If you're going to be fulltime in microgravity, you need     
14:59     
to at least have a rotational field of some sort to     
15:04     
restore um Yeah. to cancel it out.     
15:09     
Yeah. Well, okay. Yeah.     
15:15     
People don't belong in microgravity. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.     
15:20     
Yeah. So, we have to reproduce one gene. Okay. Okay. Thank you.     
15:28     
All right. Yeah, that's great. Um, so Baron, do you want to go ahead and     
15:33     
present? Uh, yeah, sure. I'll just share my screen. I'll I'll um turn everything off here.     
15:42     
Okay. So, I'll just uh uh recap on what I ended with last meet. So uh basically     
15:48     
I was thinking about this idea about why don't we use this marovian dynamics of     
15:53     
breaking the movement of the organism down into movements or vectors and use this same     
16:00     
thing for an embryo. Uh so I got a uh data set in which I could uh operate on     
16:07     
this and do some analysis. So my problem statement here was that uh the embryo     
16:14     
consists of like a lot of cells and all of them are moving in 3D tracking each cell individually is very noisy and it     
16:20     
does not capture how each cell is uh correlates with the other one in a global manner. So basically there are     
16:27     
lot of dynamics also including in this. So u there's in one way there is this elongation which is like the trend of     
16:34     
its growing and the other one is this fluctuations which is due to like the changes in it in its muscles or like uh     
16:41     
the interconnecting network of proteins which is called like the cytokeleton of the embryo and so we need a low     
16:48     
dimensional representation to like uh analyze on this uh development. So next     
16:55     
this is the data set which I worked on. It's like a cell tracking challenge. It's quite old data set. So I had some problem with it. It's like 2008 or so     
17:03     
and it had the 3D coordinates of the cells over time like in XYZ and it was extracted from the TF mass. So uh this     
17:11     
is the overview of the data set a few of the frames. So it goes from the qu like     
17:18     
the starting of the embryo till the formation of its uh the skeleton or the     
17:23     
overall shape of the embryo. So uh how do we analyze this growth like how do we     
17:28     
treat this umbrella? So we take this as a cloud of points or cells and we take a     
17:34     
center of mass and we shift the coordinates to those and we construct a garrison tensor which is like a matrix     
17:40     
uh which is used to capture the spatial distribution and the size and shape of each cell and then we uh extract the     
17:47     
principal components of each uh of its shape and then we uh analy analyze upon     
17:53     
the growth sector and the microdynamic se sector which is like the uh fluctuations in the all twitching.     
18:01     
So uh this is the iggon values which I extracted like the primary length of the     
18:06     
embryo, the width of the embryo and the depth of the embryo. And uh this is the     
18:11     
iggon space which I created using only the length and width cuz the depth of the embryo was not changing a lot. So as     
18:18     
you can see uh it's fluctuating a lot in the initial stages uh and later it's uh like it's normal     
18:26     
but it's uh fluctuating due to its uh micro uh you can say micro dynamics     
18:32     
and uh we see this like we divide this dynamics into two steps like micro state     
18:39     
and the uh macro state which is like the slow the growth or trend of the embryo     
18:44     
and the micro state which is like the muscle buildings or the cytokeleton uh     
18:50     
building of the cytokeleton. So u we have this twitching and this is     
18:55     
a dynamic simulation which I uh code through and on the left you can see the     
19:02     
embryo which is growing and how on the right the micronamics is decreasing uh     
19:09     
as the embryo is growing since uh it's getting a shape basically and uh it's     
19:14     
reaching its final form. So or the muscle twitching is getting less. It's mostly into the growth part in the next     
19:21     
part. So this is just the micronamics graph where in the initial stages the muscles is building a lot and uh at     
19:29     
later stages uh we have found the overall skeletal or the shape of the embryo and the muscles are not building     
19:36     
that much. It's mostly growing into a worm. So this is the behavioral st which I've     
19:42     
used using clustering or k means uh where uh I've separated it into four     
19:48     
shapes basically with early bean comma uh the 1.5 fold and the twofold plus and     
19:54     
this is also a center of mass based 3D uh plot which I made where the blue dots     
20:00     
are the cells you can see which are increasing and the yellow arrow is the width and the red arrow is the length of     
20:06     
the embryo. So the according to the uh center of mass of the cells the width is also changing and uh I've got the still     
20:15     
194 frames there were like thousand frames in the uh data set. So like a     
20:21     
quick recap of what we got out of all this. So basically I [clears throat] got all the 3D cell data into easy numbers     
20:27     
which is the same thing that the micro micro dynamics did. It uh separated the movement of the worm into this iggon     
20:34     
vectors to analyze it better and then also a clear separation between the slow     
20:39     
growth and the fast twitching so that we don't mess up the normal trend with the muscle twitching or the cytokeleton     
20:45     
creation which is going on and I also mapped some plots about the 2D shapes and uh how the embryo is going through     
20:54     
its development phases. So I also deployed this as a open source in the GitHub and also the data is available.     
21:01     
Uh I'll just put this uh PPD up in the slack if needed. Okay. And this this is a future what I plan to     
21:09     
do like I plan to go for better data set. The thing is that this data set was uh like I I made this locally on my     
21:16     
device. So uh this data set was the smallest I could find     
21:22     
and the new one were like 50 GB and stuff. So it was difficult for me to run it on my laptop too like I couldn't     
21:29     
properly. Uh so uh and also I read a paper about how the ages uh like there are some     
21:36     
latent variables hidden variables which also matter during the development phases. So [snorts] uh I also thought     
21:43     
about there was a paper in which the it showed how the aging of the worm depended uh depends like uh affects the     
21:51     
inner uh working of the worm. So I also thought about how can we predict the age     
21:56     
of the worm based on its behavior if we can reverse engineer that. So this is one of the ideas I also had and uh so     
22:04     
I'm open to any kind of questions or suggestions that I could use like I'm looking for a new data set or also a new     
22:10     
approach which I could go through. Yeah that's all. Uh well yeah you might want to reshare     
22:17     
your screen because I have some questions left. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. All right. But uh yeah, so the the 2008 data     
22:24     
set is usually the one we use and because you know the cell tracking is basically     
22:30     
uh you know get it's probably good enough and like you said the new you know some data sets are really large so     
22:37     
you don't it's hard to work with um but yeah so I mean basically you want     
22:42     
to have the tracking data you want to have this normalization step if you go back to the first graph that you showed     
22:49     
I think it was the uh this one here. So I couldn't see the axes. What what is     
22:54     
what are you doing in this graph? Basically the axis are the length and the width. So uh it's checking how the     
23:03     
uh length and the width is changing over time. And at the top you can see it's uh a lot of points are over there. So it's     
23:10     
like clustered over there. It's basically when the worm has got its uh shape and uh and it's not twitching a     
23:17     
lot because uh it's it has already formed its muscles and uh uh the embryo     
23:24     
is uh like developed properly. But in the initial stages it's twitching     
23:30     
a lot and it's changing shape because uh of because of the uh muscle buildings or     
23:35     
you can say the proteins are getting uh increased in number or the network is changing. Yeah. So this is tracking a     
23:43     
cell position in 2D or like length and width and then this is like reducing it. So     
23:49     
this is like over time you're tracking all cells or one cell. What what what     
23:54     
does this represent? It this is just one cell. Oh okay. So we don't know what cell this     
24:00     
is or we have Yeah, this it was like a set of cells     
24:05     
and I just tracked one cell and like this in this you can see like how I tracked one cell and how it's changing.     
24:12     
Yeah. Yeah. So this is just over time. So it's like the thing is moving around. Well, I mean     
24:21     
if you normalize it, you know, then there is kind of the uh aspect of     
24:27     
migration. If you don't normalize it, then you're just picking in in part you're picking     
24:32     
also picking up movement artifact and and differences between frames and     
24:38     
things like that. Um so that's and then so this is just     
24:43     
the I guess the in this data set it's like the it's a centrid that's     
24:50     
represented by the fluorescent signal. So we think it's mostly in the nucleus     
24:57     
although sometimes it's not always localized in the nucleus but basically     
25:02     
it's some centrid we can define in a cell. So you know that that movement of     
25:08     
course is nice to see. I I don't know what the you go back to that original graph. Um you     
25:15     
sorry. Okay. So it looks like you have like um     
25:21     
you know kind of almost like what they call levy walk which is where you have some brownie in motion in there but then     
25:28     
it moves different places and then kind of explores that place. I     
25:34     
don't know if that's just kind of a maybe an artifact of the data or what     
25:39     
but that's kind of interesting. Um this is Yeah, it is.     
25:44     
Just a brief comment. Um the twitching that's cell division, isn't it?     
25:49     
Uh could be. Yeah, that is cell division. Yes. Okay.     
25:56     
So I would assume that this part up here at the top is cell division because it's kind of in one place or     
26:03     
Yeah, that is okay. Yeah. I mean that's just interesting. I don't know. I wouldn't     
26:10     
know how to interpret that but because it's the the value it's not the actual     
26:16     
coordinates so it's pulling yeah yeah     
26:21     
um yeah so then next slide     
26:27     
uh so this is yeah okay that's the uh actual so that's a formula the residual     
26:33     
when we are yeah removing the macro movements to from the micro like the     
26:39     
micro from the macro movements basically. So there's this strength of the growth of the worm and we are removing that     
26:46     
from the like actual trend. So we are predict so we are removing the small     
26:52     
fluctuations that we get in between. So those we are categorizing into twitches.     
26:59     
Correct. Twitching. Yeah. Also it's it's probably not muscle     
27:05     
contractions per se. It's the a better a better way of saying that is the     
27:11     
acttomyasin activation. Yeah. Okay. I'll actasin complex and it's not considered     
27:19     
muscle. It's sort of it's sort of the same. Yeah. But like it's it's what I figured like I     
27:26     
just interpreted that it might be like a muscle contraction or like I got it from somewhere from the web that that it can be. So I just put it on     
27:34     
the DPD. Yeah. Replace it with acttoiasin complex or     
27:43     
I have noted that down. Yes. Okay. [laughter] Uh and then slide eight I guess.     
27:53     
Yeah. So this is this is from the data set. These are the the cell centrids,     
27:59     
the fluorescent signal. [clears throat] And then we have this this is well is     
28:05     
this a simulation or is this like the the microscopy image? I guess it's     
28:10     
probably the movie or no basic yeah basically we had it in form of frames. So I just put it all     
28:16     
together and uh I made the plots run dynamically uh along with it. So we can     
28:22     
see how the raw data changes and how the we can see the behavior of the cell as     
28:28     
well. All right. So the the two graphs here micronamics at the top and behavioral     
28:35     
state space at the bottom. So micronamics is [clears throat] time of course but then what's the yaxis?     
28:43     
Uh the y-axis is the the pixel like how much it's uh contracting or expanding.     
28:50     
Okay. based on the pixels. Yeah. Right. Yeah. It's the     
28:55     
So what's contracting or expanding? Uh like the whole the whole sent like we     
29:02     
have uh moved our cell to the center of mass like the 0000 right. So we can know     
29:08     
how it's uh changing like the boundary of the cell uh how much pixel it's moving like it's expanding or it's     
29:15     
contracting or how much it's fluctuating. Okay. uh based on that. Yeah.     
29:21     
All right. Um what do you think that is like is it the     
29:28     
what would you attribute that to? [clears throat] Okay. So in the first part of the uh     
29:35     
plot it's like it's fluctuating very much. So I'm thinking that because it's     
29:41     
in in its initial stages uh it's not able to grasp the shape the whole shape     
29:46     
of the embryo and uh there's a lot of uh you know protein are being synthesized     
29:53     
or uh we are having this uh uh cell divisions which are occurring. So uh I     
30:00     
guess it's very in like it's very much fluctuating in the initial stages but at the later stages uh uh a lot of cells     
30:08     
are have formed and it has uh achieved its uh basically this it's uh resultant     
30:15     
shape. So it's not fluctuating that much and it's moving towards the trend of the growth     
30:20     
and then uh so that and then you get like at the beginning you get a lot higher dynamics and then it settles     
30:27     
down. This looks like Yeah. Okay.     
30:32     
That's what this uh Yeah, that's what So I got Yeah, I wonder if it's subdivision     
30:39     
related as well like Yeah, I'm I'm not I'm not I'm not sure about what other components are there     
30:44     
but yeah, that's [clears throat] what I inferred initially.     
30:50     
Yeah. All right. And then uh behavioral state space is like a k means     
30:56     
uh yeah it's clustering. Yeah. Okay. So then that's length on the x axis and     
31:03     
then width on the y ais. So it's the sort of the space of the embryo and then     
31:09     
you get these the state space. So what is the state space exactly? Is     
31:15     
it um so uh along [clears throat] with time     
31:21     
the whole shape of the embryo is changing. So initially it's like a bean form. So uh like for the first five six     
31:28     
or 10 frames it's like in a beam bean formation and then it's gradually changing its formation. Uh and finally     
31:36     
it's uh getting a secure shape or like a     
31:41     
stagnant. it's getting stagnant over its shape like it's now it's a circle as you can see. So uh we can say that uh like     
31:50     
we can divide this into four stages as the embryo is growing and this only the     
31:57     
uh first 150 frames and after this it elongates as well into a warm C shape.     
32:03     
So yeah [clears throat] great then what's the next slide? I can't remember if I want to see it or     
32:10     
not. Yeah, this is it. Micronamics. This is time and what is the label on the yaxis say     
32:18     
it's the deviation from the trend like basically the pixels as as I said like how much from the trend it's it's     
32:24     
not uh moving as as as the trend should be. So basically it's subtracting the     
32:31     
usual movement from the trend and we get the fluctuations here. Okay. Yeah. So it's almost like a     
32:37     
drending or something like that where it's you're separating out the trend from the noise or something like that.     
32:46     
Yeah, we are separating the noise from the growth. So we are uh labeling the     
32:51     
noise as the this fluctuations or twitching. Okay. Uh and then you've you've     
32:56     
decomposed it into length, width and depth. So these are the three spatials. Okay. So it looks like width is like the     
33:05     
basically the largest component of variation here early on. So you width.     
33:11     
Okay, that's interesting. Well, you know, because we have divisions     
33:18     
that are left and right. So a lot of times the cell will divide. You'll have a left pair and a right pair. So they     
33:25     
have to divide out in laterally basically. Um yeah that's also there. Yeah.     
33:32     
Yeah. So with takes a big role in this kind of divisions. Yeah.     
33:38     
Uh next slide it's the same slide about this but this     
33:44     
the final stage what we have. Okay. So you've labeled the so the comma which is the around uh two to 300 cells     
33:53     
the early the bean which is early before 200 cells and then the uh what is     
34:00     
that one to fivefold or what does that mean? Yeah like uh like this something I got     
34:06     
from the internet as well like about labeling and this embryo when it's completely uh staged. So uh some papers     
34:14     
it showed that it's labeled as twofold or 1.5 fold. Oh okay. Like uh since the worm uh is like gets     
34:22     
folded when it's completely an adult form. So I guess it's something related to the that.     
34:28     
Oh right. Okay. I know what it is. All right. Um yeah.     
34:33     
Good. Uh so you've able to sort of label these clusters in that way.     
34:39     
Yeah. Right. Um, what's the next slide?     
34:47     
Okay. This is a 3D representation of how the cell is growing and how the center     
34:53     
of mass is like changing and that's where the width is also taking like the arrow is also fluctuating because of the     
34:59     
center of mass of the sense. Okay. Yeah. And then the next slide.     
35:07     
Uh next time we I have a recap and future work.     
35:13     
Yeah. Well, that's great. Thank you. Um     
35:18     
Yeah. And then you're Yeah. I also have it available as the code is also deployed publicly.     
35:24     
All right. Yeah. Wants to check it out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The data sets I mean that's     
35:31     
probably the best data set to work with is the 2008. Oh yeah. um you know they're higher     
35:37     
resolution cell tracking data sets to work with but     
35:43     
um you know and and then we do things like you know sometimes we'll want to     
35:49     
reference the you know the basic cell tracking sometimes higher resolution images so     
35:55     
you could take like specific time points and take the higher resolution data set and you know analyze     
36:03     
that. Yeah. If if you want to analyze a specific time period of the worm. Yes. Yeah. Okay.     
36:09     
Okay. Well, thank you. Yeah, that was a great that was a great     
36:14     
bit of work. Yeah. Okay. So, yeah. Okay. Okay. So, yeah. Um so, you can keep working on     
36:20     
it. Um I don't know, you know, I look forward to seeing what you have.     
36:27     
Yeah. All right. Yeah, it's great.     
36:32     
Yes, sir. Okay. Um, so thank you to Susan and Baran for presenting on their things.     
36:40     
Um, I'm going to do a paper now, I think. So, I've talked about this before     
36:46     
and I found this paper um on the physics archive. Um, it's a bioysics.     
36:55     
This is uh called road map for condensets in cell biology. So I think     
37:00     
we've talked about condensates before um in cells. So condensates you know we     
37:06     
have the cell um uh cytoplasm and in the     
37:12     
cytoplasm of course you know usually in textbooks you'll see that it's this     
37:17     
clear liquid almost like a jelly and that's why they portray it because you can see through you know uh the membrane     
37:25     
you can see the uh different organels and things like that but in reality that     
37:30     
membrane or where the the cytoplasm is very packed with things and we've     
37:36     
we've talked about how um crowding in the cell can play a role in function and     
37:42     
all of this. So it's it's much different than kind of what the textbook view is of what what the cell looks like inside.     
37:50     
So, a lot of times you'll have, you know, you'll have a lot of proteins, you'll have a lot of uh RNA molecules,     
37:57     
you'll have a lot of things moving around in there. And it's it's pretty a pretty packed place, pretty packed     
38:04     
environment. And so you know uh some of these attempts to model single cells as     
38:11     
focused uh you know explicitly on that packing that that sort of packed nature     
38:18     
of the uh of the cytoplasm. And so condensates are these structures     
38:25     
that form they're usually aggregations of like proteins or aggregations of     
38:30     
other things other biomolecules in the cytoplasm.     
38:36     
And so this is talking about this is actually a paper. It's it's about like     
38:41     
um a meeting that they had on this topic. It's become a hot topic. I think I talked about a few papers um that have     
38:49     
come out on this. But basically people are really interested in condensates. They're interested in the function of     
38:55     
condensates and so forth. So there are a lot of authors on this paper. Um not     
39:02     
going to go through who all is on it just to say there are a lot of people on it. Um so the abstract uh reads     
39:12     
biomolecular condensates govern essential cellular processes yet elude     
39:18     
description by traditional equilibrium models. Um, this road map distilled from     
39:23     
structured discussions at a workshop and reflecting the consensus of its participants clarifies key concepts to     
39:31     
researchers, funding bodies, and journals. After unifying terminology that often     
39:36     
separates disciplines, we outline the core physics of condensate formation,     
39:42     
review their biological roles, and identify outstanding challenges in non-equilibrium theory, multiscale     
39:49     
simulation, and quantitative in cell measurements. We close with a forward-looking outlook     
39:56     
to guide coordinated efforts towards predictive experimentally anchored understanding and control of     
40:03     
biomolecular condensates. So this is where you know we're we're     
40:08     
kind of at the sort of the the dawn of this field. Um     
40:16     
they did a PubMed search where they looked for phase separation and cell as the keywords which is sort of the things     
40:24     
that describe condensates. Um and this indicates a growing interest     
40:29     
in using the concept of phase separation and cell biology. You can see up to 2010     
40:35     
it was really a trivial thing. I mean, you know, when you use these keywords, they don't always refer to this sort of     
40:42     
field of condensates, but but basically, there was very little interest until about 2010, and then it ramps up um     
40:50     
after especially after 2020. So, that's it's a fairly new area.     
40:57     
Um so recent studies have highlighted that condensates are involved in a wide range     
41:03     
of essential processes including gene regulation, signal transduction,     
41:08     
metabolism, macroolelecular processing, signaling and stress response.     
41:14     
Um and then condensates are also linked to human diseases such as neurodeeneration of cancer.     
41:21     
um and even things like carbon fixation in plants. So, you know, it's really a     
41:30     
broad sort of spectrum of things that these these things are relevant to. Um     
41:35     
to fully understand how cells operate, we need to understand condensates, which in turn will enable us to target or     
41:42     
engineer them. The concepts of phase separation and condensation offer a     
41:48     
powerful framework for understanding these non-membrane bound organels. So they're they're considered organels.     
41:55     
They're not bound to the membrane. They're freely floating in the cytoplasm providing insight into how they organize     
42:01     
biomolecules in space and time. So they're not just these random clumps of     
42:06     
things. They may actually be very much functional organels. And so this is an     
42:12     
interesting kind of take on it because a lot of the things that we've read before     
42:18     
kind of give the impression that they're these clumps of things that contain a lot of nice uh biomolecules but you know     
42:26     
are is it really doing anything uh in a coordinated way? Is the function     
42:31     
coordinated or is it just function because there's something there and it's     
42:36     
sort of an aggregation of useful things to the cell.     
42:41     
uh so we need interdisciplinary science to sort of unravel what exactly     
42:47     
condensates are doing in the cell. So the concept of condensation has deep     
42:53     
roots in physics. So condensation is where things sort of form uh from a     
43:00     
liquid. So they precipitate onto into a solid. Um this is you know you'll see um     
43:08     
you know in on glass on a window sometimes when it's really humid water     
43:13     
molecules will con uh condense into liquid water. You you'll see water     
43:18     
there. That's condensation purely physical condensation. And then uh     
43:24     
[clears throat] uh biochemical condensation is where you're getting things that condensate from the     
43:30     
cytoplasm. And so that's that's how they're kind of thinking about this. So     
43:36     
initially developed to explain phase separation and thermodynamic equilibrium, these concepts have been     
43:41     
continuously refined to describe more complex situations in soft matter physics. Similar principles     
43:49     
were invoked in biology long before any molecular details were understood.     
43:55     
So early observations of cellular space hinted at numerous liquidlike self     
44:00     
assemblies without membranes. So we have these self assemblies that come together     
44:05     
in the cytoplasm. Um and you know they people saw these     
44:11     
and didn't really know what to make of them. Advances in molecular biology and imaging has since since revealed that     
44:18     
the complex composition of dynamics of these structures bridging phenomenology     
44:23     
with underlying mechanisms in increasing detail. So this figure two is sort of a     
44:29     
map of the historical development of condensates and cell biology thinking     
44:34     
you know back in well the history of physics soft matter physics but also in     
44:40     
cell biology and how they've kind of come together since the 1990s     
44:45     
to address this question. So in soft matter physics um     
44:51     
we go to soft matter physics first we have Vanderwal's who uh looked at the     
44:57     
physics of condensation this was back in 1873     
45:03     
uh uh coasservation which was a bunenberg dong and croo in     
45:11     
in 1929 uh then thermodynamics of polymer     
45:16     
solutions florine Huggin 1942 then complex coacervation over beacon in     
45:23     
1957. So there was a a a fair amount of soft matter physics done on condensation     
45:30     
and polymers and things settling out in polymer solutions in the thermodynamics     
45:37     
because it's important to know kind of you know in um in the condensation of     
45:43     
water and glass there's a thermodynamics there. There's a temperature gradient     
45:48     
and we have this thermodynamics that's interesting. Um maybe maybe it's trivial     
45:55     
in that case but it's interesting in in an environment like the cell.     
46:02     
Um then for the on the cell biology side uh we have the structure of protoplasm     
46:07     
which was in 1899 that was Wilson uh uh Oparin published the origin of     
46:13     
life in 1938. um then and that that was kind of like     
46:19     
where people were looking at this but they didn't really understand the physics of it. They just understood that     
46:25     
these were interesting structures in the cell. And then in 1995 you have phase     
46:31     
separation and cytoplasm and brooks. This is the I I take it the first attempt to sort of merge the the soft     
46:38     
matter physics of the cell biology. Um in 2007 nuclear pores hydrogel Frank     
46:45     
Gorlich um then we had in 2009 P granules     
46:52     
Ranguin and Hyman uh and then in 2012 SH3 PRM Fus Rosen     
47:00     
and Mcnite. So I'm not really familiar with I I know the P granules work but I'm not familiar with this work here.     
47:10     
So the future directions going into the future looking at complex superm     
47:15     
molecular organization. So you know what happens at you know when you have a lot of uh molecules at a     
47:23     
very high density um what what do they do uh what what is the complexity there?     
47:30     
Uh the dynamics and control in living cells. So you know do we understand all     
47:35     
the signaling implications of the of these condensates? Do we understand what     
47:41     
it how it exists in the sort of the the hierarchy of signaling um systems in the     
47:47     
cell? And of course we also need to be more explicit in linking physical     
47:53     
organization to biological function. So what are the consequences of     
47:59     
thermodynamic fluctuations in the cell? How does that affect things in the cell membrane? How does that affect things in     
48:06     
terms of transcription and translation for that matter? Because we know that those things are highly regulated. Um,     
48:12     
and a lot of times it's based on what the cell needs at any given time. We see     
48:18     
these studies where people will look at gene expression and they'll look at like if you probe the cell, if you uh raise     
48:26     
it in a certain environment or you uh give it a drug treatment or you um knock     
48:31     
out another gene in the network, you know, it it it changes the the uh     
48:36     
regulation of that gene of of another gene. So what what is the signaling there? Because remember these     
48:43     
condensates in part are the products of aggregation of different macroolelecules. The macroolelecules     
48:49     
ultimately come from gene expression where they're produced at a certain rate. And so if there there's some     
48:57     
signaling there that tells the the you know transcriptional machinery to make     
49:03     
more of something or less of something that would be an interesting thing to know.     
49:09     
Um then there condensates of course in development, evolution and disease. They     
49:14     
didn't really talk too much about development at least not yet in this article but they do have some     
49:20     
interesting things to I mean I think there's some interesting topics in terms of how condensates play a role in     
49:26     
development um evolution and of course disease which was talked about earlier     
49:32     
and then their engineering and medical opportunities as there always are.     
49:37     
So that was a little bit about that. Then they talk a little bit about condensates and what they are. So as it     
49:44     
turns out the term biomolelecular condensate is controversial.     
49:49     
Um some might consider all cellular structures to be condensates since all structures comprise condensed matter.     
49:58     
So that means that if you have like a material that has a mix of liquids and     
50:03     
solids, that's a condensate technically. But that's not necessarily what others     
50:10     
claim. Uh others might claim that nothing is a condensate since they define condensate is emerging through a     
50:16     
phase transition. So they have a more of a a functional definition than a structural one which would require     
50:23     
infinitely large systems to unambiguously identify them using tools from statistical mechanics. So you know     
50:30     
some people define a condensate as being formed by a specific process where you have a phase transition and you can look     
50:37     
at that phase transition through statistical mechanics and define where that happens. Other people just say well     
50:45     
you know anything can be a condensate as long as it has a structural uh the     
50:51     
structural properties we expect. But this isn't really helpful for what     
50:56     
we need to understand in the cell because you know it's hard to measure     
51:02     
uh biological condensets in the way that we might measure them in uh like a     
51:09     
experimental physics environment. Uh whereas you know just defining the     
51:14     
entire cell as a condensate is not useful either. Um so people have     
51:20     
developed a wealth of terms like aggregates, blobs, bodies, clusters,     
51:26     
fosi, granules, hubs, macroolecular assemblies, micro domains, nodules,     
51:34     
puncta, ribosome exclusion zones, speckles, spots, and other things.     
51:41     
Although those are the ones that you might see in the biological literature to describe     
51:48     
what we might put in this category of biomolecular condensates. So what     
51:53     
they're saying here is that if you go back in the biological cell biology literature, the cell biology literature,     
52:01     
you know, people are looking at things under a microscope. They're trying to describe them. Sometimes they give them     
52:06     
some sort of quai functional cast where they say this thing looks like something     
52:14     
that looks like a granle or you know fosi or a blob you know and which are     
52:22     
maybe suggest some sort of function that doesn't exist or it's something that you     
52:28     
know looks like something else in the world and so it's hard to know kind of you know what that thing is and these     
52:35     
terms stick around. So, it's hard to really kind of, you know, once we learn more about these structures, it's hard     
52:41     
to really know um what they do. Partially, this is a problem of language     
52:47     
where we have these terms that are maybe unhelpful, but also, you know, really     
52:52     
kind of getting into the function. Do things that are described as blobs all behave the same or do all blobs behave     
53:00     
the same as aggregates or granules or whatever? So, you know, we we don't     
53:06     
really understand the good, you know, all of the variation here     
53:11     
and it's it's a mistake to lump them all maybe into this category. On the other     
53:18     
hand, you know, they probably have very similar functions.     
53:23     
um such a zoo of terminology with subtly distinct meanings hinders coherent communication     
53:28     
and suggests that clarifying the concept of condensates themselves might be helpful. So I mean there's some     
53:34     
reinterpretation there but also just understanding what we mean by condensate     
53:40     
is also important. So all condensates really have the     
53:45     
similar properties. uh researchers tend to agree that condensates are in compartments with very different     
53:52     
composition from their surroundings. So it's like you know you have like any sort of structure in a cell. It's     
53:59     
compartmentalized. It has things inside of it that are different than the outside. And usually     
54:05     
that's done to protect that structure from the environment. Um these     
54:12     
surroundings are separated by a well- definfined interface that is not established by a lipid membrane.     
54:17     
Condensates are non-membrane bound compartments that can exclude membrane bound organ such as the nucleus or     
54:25     
mitochondria. Sometimes they associate with one another.     
54:30     
People also tend to agree that condensates have dynamic non stochometric     
54:36     
composition. So individual complexes like the ribosome don't count.     
54:41     
So um and you know this is just kind of excluding different things in the cell that you     
54:48     
might uh you know if you look under a microscope you might misattribute it to     
54:53     
a condensate. Moreover, condensates are typically described as having at least in part an     
55:00     
amorphous internal structure. It's just a bundle of macroolelecules     
55:05     
in which the relative positions of molecules are not guaranteed to exclude ordered structures such as amaloid like     
55:11     
aggregates and microtubules. So this is again where you see things sometimes     
55:16     
that are microtubule uh bundles or amaloid aggregates     
55:22     
um and those are not the same thing as what we're talking about. Finally, many     
55:28     
people stress that condensates exhibit emergent properties. In other words, the properties of individual molecules     
55:34     
differ from those of the collective. However, it's unclear at what size or     
55:40     
molecule count such properties emerge. So, how large does a condensate have to     
55:45     
be? And in that sense, we don't have any hard and fast rules. It doesn't seem to be deterministic. So, it's probably some     
55:52     
sort of stochastic uh process of self assembly. and then at some point they     
55:58     
behave differently according to some sort of phase transition. Um so this is all kind of unknown or not     
56:06     
clear to people. So there was this workshop at the KITP which is in California.     
56:12     
Uh this was the physical principle shaping biomolecular condensates workshop happened in 2025. So this is     
56:20     
their blackboard where they kind of laid out some of these ideas about what condensates are and what they are not.     
56:27     
Um you know they had a whole bunch of things that they talked about. Um you     
56:35     
know thinking about everything from the structure to the function to the dynamical systems aspect of it. And then     
56:43     
of course you have to go through all these defining terms um what to look for     
56:48     
what kinds of properties do they share what kinds of things can be excluded and     
56:54     
in that of course you have a lot of heterogeneity so that's what makes this a very hard     
57:00     
problem. Uh but there are a lot of interesting physics and a lot of interesting     
57:05     
biology. So this is interest. So there are al     
57:12     
also more controversial properties that are often discussed in the context of condensates.     
57:18     
Um some papers equate condensates with liquid liquid phase separation. But it is often neither clear whether     
57:25     
the involved objects have liquidlike properties or maybe also some solid-like     
57:31     
properties. Um nor whether they actually form by phase separation. So sometimes things     
57:38     
form by phase separation, sometimes they don't. sometime or the formal process that we     
57:43     
recognize. Sometimes they have just liquid properties, sometimes they have some solid properties. As you can     
57:49     
imagine, if you have these sort of just tangles or, you know, aggregates of     
57:54     
things, it includes, you know, sometimes it'll include all sorts of things in it.     
58:00     
Um, and so in any case, phase separation denotes the process whereas the outcome     
58:06     
is better described as phase coexistence. base coexistence is unambiguously     
58:11     
defined only in terms of thermodynamically large equilibrium systems. So its validity in small living     
58:18     
cells out of equilibrium is unclear. So sometimes we have these physical concepts that we were trying to apply     
58:25     
to things like cells and we have to be careful because you know they look like     
58:31     
the thing that we see in physical systems but they may not behave exactly in the same way.     
58:39     
Um, [clears throat] finally, condensates are often associated with biological function, but some condensates may form     
58:45     
without biological function. In any case, proving biological function can be     
58:50     
hard and but it is still useful to discuss condensates even when their     
58:55     
biological function is yet unclear so we can have some grasp of what's     
59:01     
going on with the structure. And so the you know this rest of the     
59:07     
paper I think really kind of goes through both the physics of condensates and the biology of condensates.     
59:14     
Um and so if you're interested in that um that can help you know clarify a lot     
59:20     
of things. Um so figure four is the physical framework of condensation     
59:25     
describes how various control parameters affect condensate properties. So here     
59:30     
they're looking at control parameters of course as a way to maybe     
59:37     
you know uh manipulate condensates experimentally or use them for medical purposes or engineering purposes. So     
59:44     
they define some control parameters and then they have these condensate properties and they're not quite sure     
59:51     
how they all kind of interrelate but they they know that the control parameters should vary the condensate     
59:58     
properties in certain ways that are you know perhaps useful to engineers or to     
1:00:04     
experimentalists. So control parameters include intermolecular affinities. We're talking     
1:00:11     
about biochemistry, biochemical affinities, molecular concentration, how     
1:00:17     
what's the concentration of molecules, um intracellular structures,     
1:00:24     
physical fields and extrinsic exttrinsic stimuli and then active processes in the     
1:00:30     
cell. So these are all things that are contributing to condensates, controlling     
1:00:36     
their size, controlling their shape, their material properties and so forth.     
1:00:42     
And then the properties themselves, their composition, what have they made of precisely, location in the cell, you     
1:00:50     
know, maybe they're close to the nucleus versus out near the memory. Yeah, that may be important.     
1:00:56     
The kinetics are the timing of formation, the material properties, the internal     
1:01:03     
organization and the morphology which is defined in terms of size and shape. So     
1:01:09     
these are all kind of um you know this is building towards sort of a model of being able to manipulate condensates in     
1:01:16     
a way that helps us to control them or understand their structure better.     
1:01:23     
So these control parameters are the knobs and they kind of go through the definitions here.     
1:01:29     
Um they actually have some success stories which is where we can understand     
1:01:35     
some of the details of um condensates that are understandable to science. So P     
1:01:42     
granules is interesting because it comes from sea elegance. So um among the first     
1:01:49     
condensates described as such are pranules and if you look at an embry a     
1:01:54     
sea elegance embryo you'll see pranules in this in the images     
1:02:00     
um and pranules um are part of this p sublineage which is the germ cell     
1:02:07     
sublineage. So if you look at a lineage tree, you'll see that there is, you know, there are these founder cells and     
1:02:14     
then there's this lineage called P and there's P1, P2, P3 and it branches off     
1:02:19     
early and it's basically where the germ cells get specified. So it's where the     
1:02:25     
eggs and you know different um components of the uh reproductive system     
1:02:32     
get specified and pranules are in that sublineage and     
1:02:38     
they uh play a role in germ cell specification. So this is you know you'll see this in     
1:02:45     
different microscopy images. Branules are initially distributed throughout the one cell embryo which is where we have a     
1:02:53     
fertilized embryo that doesn't hasn't made any cell divisions yet but are ultimately inherited by the posterior     
1:02:59     
daughter cell at division. So you have one cell it divides into AP and P1. The     
1:03:06     
P1 is actually the uh posterior end of the worm but it will become that P     
1:03:13     
lineage which is the germ lineage. So you have P1, P2, P3 and then by the time     
1:03:19     
you get to P4, that's the germ lineage. So P granules are in this uh P uh part of     
1:03:29     
the you know the posterior part of the embryo and then eventually they localize into the germ [clears throat] cell. So     
1:03:36     
that's interesting because if we remember when we talked about these condensates,     
1:03:41     
we didn't know where they were going, what what role they played in terms of their position. We just kind of thought     
1:03:47     
of them as stuff that's randomly floating throughout the cytoplasm. But now we know that at least in C elegance     
1:03:53     
embryos, they localize in certain cells that are dividing and     
1:03:59     
ultimately get down to some sublineage. So you know that's interesting because     
1:04:06     
that suggests that the pranules kind of have a map of where to be during     
1:04:12     
cell division so that when the cell divides it's in the right cell     
1:04:19     
in the right daughter cell. Okay. So um that's and then this asymmetric     
1:04:25     
segregation first described in 1982 by this citation here 19 cannot be     
1:04:31     
explained by cytoplasmic flows or localized degradation. Instead brangin at all proposed an     
1:04:38     
alternative mechanism before cell division pranules in the anterior half     
1:04:43     
of the embryo shrink and dissolve while those in the posterior half condense and grow. So they can shrink and they can     
1:04:50     
grow and in this case they're doing this differentially. This novel description explained not     
1:04:56     
only a asymmetric localization of pranules in the embryo but also their     
1:05:02     
fusion dripping and wetting behavior in the adult gonad.     
1:05:07     
Um and so that's uh one example. Then there's some examples from bacteria.     
1:05:13     
Um that's that's linked to the polarizing polar organizing protein Z or     
1:05:19     
POP Z micro domain. Um the in sexually reproducing organisms     
1:05:26     
genetic diversity is generated through DNA exchange between homo homologous     
1:05:31     
chromosomes during meiosis. uh numerous doublestranded breaks are formed along each chromosome, but only a     
1:05:38     
few of these sites become crossovers. Puditive crossover sites interfere with     
1:05:43     
one another such as that mature crossovers are distantly spaced. So this     
1:05:49     
was observed in Drosophila in 1913 uh where they've and actually looking at     
1:05:55     
a rapidopsis which is a plant and the animal segans     
1:06:01     
now suggest that the number and positioning of crossovers are determined by corsening of recombination nodules.     
1:06:08     
Recombination nodules are condensates that form at at double stranded brakes.     
1:06:14     
Nodule components such as the ringfinger protein diffuse laterally along the synap uh     
1:06:21     
synapt complex that hold homologous chromosomes together redistributing from many small     
1:06:28     
nodules to a few large nodules which then per promote crossover formation. So     
1:06:34     
this is these nodules that occur during um uh DNA replication and um     
1:06:42     
transcription. So even you know this is something that happens in different places in the cell     
1:06:49     
and not just um you know so condensed have very uh wide ranging functions and     
1:06:57     
so you know if we're going to create this sort of new category of biology you know we have to uh keep an open mind I     
1:07:05     
guess the idea being that condensates have sort of certain similar physical     
1:07:10     
characteristics similar functional biological characteristics.     
1:07:17     
So yeah, then so that's the paper. Um     
1:07:23     
I think that's actually pretty interesting based on kind of some of the things we're interested in with     
1:07:29     
cytokeleton and some of the things we're interested in with biological function     
1:07:34     
in cells and of course cell division because this process relies on cell     
1:07:41     
division quite a bit. So yeah, I was I was impressed with both     
1:07:47     
of the presentations today. Um did we have any other questions before we go?     
1:07:56     
Uh no. Yeah.     
1:08:02     
Uh I wanted to ask uh if there's anything I could work on further     
1:08:07     
uh about this. Uh well I mean you know probably um I I think some of the graphs     
1:08:13     
you made were interesting. Um I would keep working maybe if you some of the     
1:08:19     
graphs are just based on one cell. So you know if you can look across cells     
1:08:24     
other use other cells. Okay. So get the spatial context basically.     
1:08:29     
Yeah. I mean because there you know there are differences between cells of course. Yeah. [clears throat] Okay. Yeah. We     
1:08:35     
want to know if like maybe other cells are behaving differently. In the lineage tree, you'll notice that not all, you     
1:08:40     
know, sometimes you have sublineages. You'll have things at the anterior end,     
1:08:46     
you have things at the posterior end, and they're going to behave differently. Um, so that's one thing. Um, and then     
1:08:52     
label, of course, label what cell you're looking at. Um, are you looking at like     
1:08:59     
some AD cell or something in the poster end of the embryo or what?     
1:09:06     
Okay. Yeah. Another thing was the the one the you know we talked about that graph that     
1:09:13     
had like the the properties where the movements kind of clustered and that     
1:09:19     
might be cell division. We could figure that out if we knew what cell it was and     
1:09:24     
we knew the time stamp. So if we could have the Yeah. Okay. What specific time stamp is it? And then     
1:09:30     
we can go look it up and say that's that's what's happening in that cell. Uh because a lot so basically uh get a clear explanation     
1:09:39     
on what is happening and why it's happening during that time step. Yeah. the the so each cell each     
1:09:46     
developmental cell that we're looking at in in the data set has a certain lifespan. It get it divides     
1:09:53     
[clears throat] from a mother cell. It lives for a while and then it divides or     
1:09:58     
sometimes it dies off. Uh but that that lifespan is basically     
1:10:03     
um finite. You know, we're looking at basically it's a newly divided cell. It's migrating to a position and then     
1:10:10     
it's dividing again. when it divides again then it the the daughter cells move somewhere else and that process     
1:10:18     
continues. So sometimes it makes sense to maybe track the uh en values for     
1:10:25     
multiple cells that are to one another. So like you see if you look at     
1:10:33     
um lineage tree if you know what if you if you know where to find that I can send you a link. um you can find the     
1:10:40     
daughters pretty easily and they're always the same. So it's like in any data set they'll always be the same but     
1:10:46     
you can see that kind of progression uh through the Okay.     
1:10:53     
So those are kind of things you know to follow up on.     
1:10:58     
All right. I'll look into those. Yeah. All right. So Susan Yeah. said there's a journal of     
1:11:04     
biological physics talk by Mata Sarah. Okay. Katia Sarah I know that is then     
1:11:10     
you see San Diego um yeah [clears throat] it was about aven gastrolation and it     
1:11:18     
was very good it shows the acttomyasin where acttomyasin gathers in the aven     
1:11:24     
embryo as the neural tube is formed as a the neural streak is formed and it's     
1:11:32     
interesting you can see that there's a a loop of it this way and     
1:11:40     
some on the sides like it. It's almost like it's um differentiation waves where     
1:11:46     
there is acttomyasin there there is cell cramping or cell division. So     
1:11:52     
okay it this correlates. So um that's an interesting lecture to watch.     
1:12:00     
Yeah. And I noticed Dick wasn't there so I think he should be watching it but     
1:12:05     
Yeah. Yeah. I noted it down. Yeah. Okay. Well, um they just sent me a copy     
1:12:12     
of where to find the um lecture     
1:12:18     
because it was recorded. Yeah. Would you would you like that or Yeah. Yeah.     
1:12:23     
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Okay. Well, I'll um I'll send it to Bradley and um     
1:12:31     
and uh you can distribute it. Okay.     
1:12:36     
Um, unless I have your email, but I can I can put in my email here.     
1:12:43     
Okay.     
1:12:49     
Ah, okay. All right. [clears throat] I will get     
1:12:55     
that and I'll send it send it to you.     
1:13:00     
All right. Thank you so much. Yeah. Okay. All right. See you next week.     
1:13:06     
All right. [clears throat] Okay. Bye. Thank you. Thank you everyone.
